Question: what is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?
Ideal: to simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product. 
Response: a prototype program provides a basic groundwork from which to further enhance and improve a solution to a problem.

Question: what stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage?
Ideal: the testing stage can influence both the coding stage (phase 5) and the solution refinement stage (phase 7) 
Response: the testing stage has a direct influence on the final version of a program, being as it is the debugging and finalization of a software revision.

Question: what are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?
Ideal: abstraction and reusability.
Response: modular, reusable code, allowing faster deployment of solutions, and a more general view of a solution.

Question: where do c++ programs begin to execute?
Ideal: at the main function.
Response: c++ programs begin execution at main.

Question: what is a variable?
Ideal: a location in memory that can store a value.
Response: a variable is the memory address for a specific type of stored data, or from a mathematical perspective, a symbol representing a fixed definition with changing values.

Question: where are variables declared in a c++ program?
Ideal: variables can be declared anywhere in a program. they can be declared inside a function (local variables) or outside the functions (global variables)
Response: variables are usually declared at the beginning of a module of c++ code.

Question: what is the main difference between a while and a do...while statement?
Ideal: the block inside a do...while statement will execute at least once.
Response: while tests for true first before running, do...while runs once first before checking.

Question: what is typically included in a class definition?
Ideal: data members (attributes) and member functions.
Response: it begins with class, followed by the class name, then usually a constructor, data members and member functions that delineates the class is included in any class's definition.

Question: what is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?
Ideal: data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.
Response: a data member exists permanently in that program's memory as long as it's run.a local variable inside a member function is temporal and only used to operate in the function and exists as long as the function is run.

Question: what is the difference between a constructor and a function?
Ideal: a constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type.
Response: a constructor is used to create an object that can be employed in the main function of a program.  this may or may not execute code along with it.a function is a set of code that executes when called, but does not create a new object.

Question: when does c++ create a default constructor?
Ideal: if no constructor is provided, the compiler provides one by default. if a constructor is defined for a class, the compiler does not create a default constructor.
Response: when no constructor was specified in the constructor's class, but the class is instantiated in a program.

Question: how many constructors can be created for a class?
Ideal: unlimited number.
Response: a very large amount of constructors can be created for any given class through overloading.  when two constructors with a different type or number of parameters are created, they are said to be overloaded, and c++ can recognize which constructor to use based on the type of the variables that are passed/returned.

Question: what is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?
Ideal: a function prototype includes the function signature, i.e., the name of the function, the return type, and the parameters' type. the function definition includes the actual body of the function. 
Response: a function definition is the code that defines the function placed in the {} brackets that determines that function's operation.a function prototype shows the function's public interface without exposing implementation.  it shows name, return type and type of paramaters.

Question: what is the role of a header-file?
Ideal: to store a class interface, including data members and member function prototypes.
Response: to hold reusable content or modules separate from the actual  source-code file that can be easily referenced and employed for different programs.

Question: what does a function signature include?
Ideal: the name of the function and the types of the parameters.
Response: the function signature includes the method name and the input types. 

Question: what is the scope of global variables?
Ideal: file scope.
Response: the scope of global variables is at the file level.

Question: how does the compiler handle inline functions?
Ideal: it makes a copy of the function code in every place where a function call is made.
Response: inline functions are copied in place, instead of being referenced.

Question: what is the main advantage associated with function arguments that are passed by reference? 
Ideal: it avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.
Response: passing by reference eliminates the copying of large amounts of data, typical with pass by value.

Question: how are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?
Ideal: based on the function signature. when an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call.
Response: overloaded functions are differentiated by their parameters.

Question: when defining a recursive function, what are possible causes for infinite recursion?
Ideal: if the recursion step is defined incorrectly, or if the base case is not included.
Response: no base case, or an incorrectly written recursion step that does not converge on the base case will lead to infinite recursion.

Question: what are the similarities between iteration and recursion?
Ideal: they both involve repetition; they both have termination tests; they can both occur infinitely.
Response: many problems can be solved by both iteration and recursion, and either may go into a condition of infinite execution if a termination test is omitted.

Question: what are the two different ways of specifying the length of an array?
Ideal: in the array declaration, or by using an initializer list.
Response: manually inside the brackets or automatically via an initializer list

Question: what is the main difference between strings declared using the type string versus strings declared using an array of characters?
Ideal: the strings declared using an array of characters have a null element added at the end of the array.
Response: if by type string, the array contains an additional terminating null character

Question: how are arrays passed to functions?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: by reference

Question: what is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?
Ideal: the arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program; that is, they are initialized only once, when the function that declares the array it is first called. 
Response: a static member prevents naming conflicts (not put into global namespace) while allowing for information hiding (private, public).

Question: how many dimensions need to be specified when passing a multi-dimensional array as an argument to a function?
Ideal: all the dimensions, except the first one. 
Response: when passing (in main) a multidimensional array to a function, no dimensions need be specified

Question: using an index outside the bounds of the array generates an error. is this a compilation error or a run-time error?
Ideal: run-time error.
Response: run-time

Question: how are bi-dimensional arrays stored in memory, by rows or by columns?
Ideal: by rows.
Response: by-dimensional arrays are stored by row

Question: in one sentence, what is the main idea implemented by insertion sort?
Ideal: taking one array element at a time, from left to right, it inserts it in the right position among the already sorted elements on its left. 
Response: insertion sort progresses through a list of elements and determines where the next element should be inserted into an already sorted array starting with sorting and using the first two elements.

Question: in one sentence, what is the main idea implemented by selection sort?
Ideal: taking one array element at a time, from left to right, it identifies the minimum from the remaining elements and swaps it with the current element.
Response: find the smallest value in the list and make it the first element, then find the smallest value of the leftover list and make it the first element of the leftover list and continue until the list is sorted.

Question: what is the number of operations for insertion sort under a best-case scenario, and what is the best-case scenario?
Ideal: n (the length of the array) operations achieved for a sorted array.
Response: in the best case scenario of an already sorted list, insertion sort will progress once through the list.  so the number of operations is directly proportional to the number of elements in the list.  also noted as o(n) in big o notation.

Question: what is the base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort?
Ideal: when the size of the array to be sorted is 1 (or 2)
Response: a list or array of only 1 element.

Question: what is a pointer?
Ideal: a variable that contains the address in memory of another variable.
Response: it is a variable that contains not only a *value but has a memory address associated with it, and can be moved along a string or an array by jumping up one memory address.

Question: what does the address (&) operator return?
Ideal: the memory address of its operand.
Response: the memory address of operand, 0x000000 or something along those lines. 

Question: what does the star (*) operator return?
Ideal: an alias (synonym) for the name of the object that its operand points to in memory. it is the dereferencing operator.
Response: the value of the object that the operand points to

Question: how can an array be addressed in pointer/offset notation?
Ideal: by initializing a pointer to point to the first element of the array, and then incrementing this pointer with the index of the array element.
Response: takes the number of array elements and points to each at a time

Question: what does the sizeof operator return?
Ideal: the size in bytes of its operand.
Response: the size of an operand in bytes. used with variable names, type names, and constant values

Question: what are the different ways to pass a pointer to a function?
Ideal: there are four ways: nonconstant pointer to constant data, nonconstant pointer to nonconstant data, constant pointer to constant data, constant pointer to nonconstant data.
Response: non-constant pointer to non-constant data, non-constant pointer to constant data, constant pointer to constant data,constant pointer to non-constant data.

Question: what is a function pointer?
Ideal: the address of the location in memory where the function code resides.
Response: pointer variables that point to function addresses.

Question: what is a linked list?
Ideal: a collection of elements that can be allocated dynamically.
Response: a data type that contains a pointer to at least the next  element in a list.

Question: what is the main advantage of linked lists over arrays?
Ideal: the linked lists can be of variable length.
Response: nearly infinite size, limited only by system memory and also the ability to expand the size dynamically.

Question: what is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?
Ideal: the elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal).
Response: direct access to elements, and speed, linked lists have increased search times to access elements even if the list is sorted. ( like getting the last element without a pointer directly to the end of the list. )

Question: how are linked lists passed as arguments to a function?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: as a pointer node.

Question: what is the difference between a circular linked list and a basic linked list?
Ideal: the last element in a circular linked list points to the head of the list.
Response: how to determine the end of the list, in basic linked lists the last element links to a null pointer, while circular linked lists link to the head element at the end.

Question: what is the main advantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?
Ideal: all the deletion and insertion operations can be performed in constant time, including those operations performed before a given location in the list or at the end of the list.
Response:  ability to backtrack through a list.

Question: what is the main disadvantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?
Ideal: extra space required to store the back pointers.
Response: increased actions to add and remove elements to the linked list.

Question: what is a stack?
Ideal: a data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the first to be removed (or last-in-first-out)
Response: a stack is an abstract data type which operates on a last in first out basis for storing a list of objects, and does not support ( at least in the pure stack) peeking at a element without removing the rest of the stack first.

Question: what are the two main functions defined by a stack?
Ideal: push and pop
Response: push ( to add to a item the stack)pop  ( to pull the last item added from an array. )

Question: how can you implement a stack with an array?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array.
Response: for efficiency it is easiest to implement the left to right method, with the right most item being the one that is retrieved when a pop is performed, and a push places an object on the furthest element.

Question: how can you implement a stack with a list?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack pointing to the head of the linked list, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements at the beginning of the list.
Response: have the head of the list be the last item added, and a push just adds a new head.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: list based, because of the lower processing overhead and nearly unlimited space, due to linked list design.

Question: how are infix expressions evaluated by computers?
Ideal: first, they are converted into postfix form, followed by an evaluation of the postfix expression.
Response: i have an hard time explaining this so i'll show how infix is evaluated instead.start with an infix expression, like, (((5+2)*5)+(400/(2+3))), and  push items until you get a ")" and once that happens, perform the operations until you reach an "("... with that complete, you will now have ((7*5)+(400/(2+3))) as now the expression that will be evaluated... perform last step again...(35+(400/(2+3))) is now the stack.... repeat agian...(35+(400/5)) is now the stack after that.... repeat...(35+80) is now the stack, repeat again...115 is now the stack, and is returned.

Question: what operations would you need to perform to find a given element on a stack?
Ideal: pop all the elements and store them on another stack until the element is found, then push back all the elements on the original stack.
Response: depends on the type of stack, on a true stack you will haft to pop all of the elements of the stack until you find the element you want, and then after that you will need to push all the elements that where removed back in to the stack in the order that they where removed.with a java style stack, where there is a peek function, it will return the element you wanted instead of requiring you to perform all the excessive actions that are required from a true stack.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the last to be removed (or first-in-first-out).
Response: a first in, first out abstract data type that can be used to store values.

Question: what are the two main functions defined by a queue?
Ideal: enqueue and dequeue
Response: enque ( data ),  deque ( )

Question: how can you implement a queue with an array?
Ideal: use a circular array. keep the rear of the queue toward the end of the array, and the front toward the beginning, and allow the rear pointer to wrap around.
Response: create a fixed array size, with with 2 integers to point to the beginning and the end of the que, and special cases to know when the que is empty or full.

Question: how can you implement a queue with a list?
Ideal: keep the rear of the queue pointing to the tail of the linked list, so the enqueue operation is done at the end of the list, and keep the front of the queue pointing to the head of the linked list, so the dequeue operation is done at the beginning of the list.
Response: fairly easy... singly linked list with a pointer to the head and tail of hte list.deque first item in que, create temp pointer to next element, delete head, and then make head the temporary pointer.enque new item, use pointer to end of list, add a new item to the next item of the tail, and make the tail the next item of the current tail.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred for a queue, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: list based, because of the lessened memory usage initially, and the increased limits on how large the que can become.

Question: what is the stack operation corresponding to the enqueue operation in queues?
Ideal: push
Response: that would be the push operation, if it put the item at the end of the list.

Question: what data structure is more appropriate for scheduling printing jobs at a printer, a stack or a queue?
Ideal: queue
Response: queue, because of the first in first out principles, and if it was a stack it would be last in last out,  because it could possibly not let the first item that was added get removed in a timely manner.

Question: what is a tree?
Ideal: a collection of nodes, which has a special node called root, and the rest of the nodes are partitioned into one or more disjoint sets, each set being a tree.
Response: it organizes data in a nonlinear, hierarchical form, where items can have more than one successor.partitioned into a root node and subsets are general subtrees of the root.

Question: what is the height of a tree?
Ideal: the length of the longest path from the root to any of its leaves.
Response: the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to the leaf.

Question: what is a leaf?
Ideal: a node that has no children.
Response: a node with no children.

Question: what is a binary tree?
Ideal: a tree for which the maximum number of children per node is two.
Response: starting at the root node, it branches off into one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root.each node has at most two children, the left child and the right child.

Question: what is a binary search tree?
Ideal: a binary tree that has the property that for any node the left child is smaller than the parent which in turn is smaller than the right child.
Response: a binary tree where the value in any node n is greater than the value in every node n's left subtree, but less than every value in n's right subtree.

Question: what is the inorder traversal of a binary tree?
Ideal: traverse the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
Response: it travels left to right

Question: how many comparisons does it take to find an element in a binary search tree?
Ideal: the height of the tree (or log of the number of elements in the tree).
Response: o(n)

Question: what are the elements typically included in a class definition?
Ideal: function members and data members.
Response: a class definition typically includes the class name, the classes constructor(s), and any extra functions and class variables.

Question: what are the access-specifiers that can be used in a c++ class definition?
Ideal: private and public.
Response: a c++ class definition may include access-specifiers public, private, and static.

Question: how are objects initialized when they are created?
Ideal: by using constructors.
Response: objects are initialized essentially as copies of the corresponding classes, complete with their own separate variables.

Question: what is a function signature?
Ideal: the name of the function and the list of parameters, including their types.
Response: a function signature specifies the name and input variables of a function.

Question: what is a recursive function?
Ideal: a function that calls itself.
Response: a recursive function typically simplifies a problem by calling itself, until arriving at a base case, at which it recursively returns a solution.

Question: what is the alternative way to solve a problem that could be solved through recursive functions?
Ideal: through iteration.
Response: many recursive solutions may also be solved with looping control statements, such as while, for, do-while, etc.

Question: what is the difference between an array that is declared as static and one that is not?
Ideal: the static arrays are intialized only once when the function is called.
Response: a static array has class scope, allowing it to remain where other arrays might be recycled.

Question: what is the main difference between a string of characters that is read into a variable of type string versus a variable of type char[]?
Ideal: the char[] will automatically add a null \0 character at the end of the string.
Response: type char[] may contain a null value as the last element, whereas type string will not.

Question: briefly describe the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
Ideal: divide a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and then combine the solutions into a solution for the original problem.
Response: the divide and conquer paradigm, splits a large problem into simpler problems, at which point it solves the simpler problems and merges the simple solutions together to answer the large problem.

Question: briefly describe in one sentence how does merge sort work?
Ideal: it splits the original array into two, sorts each of the two halves, and then merges the sorted arrays.
Response: merge sort recursively divides an array into two arrays until all arrays have 1 element, at which point it merges the 1 element arrays into larger sorted arrays, the final returned array being the sorted version of the initial array.

Question: what is a pointer?
Ideal: the address of a location in memory.
Response: its a data type with a memory address and a value

Question: what is the experimental approach for measuring the running time of an algorithm?
Ideal: implement the algorithm and measure the physical running time.
Response: to run the program through and see how many times each thing is called and the runtime of each function is based on that.

Question: order the following functions by their running time: n^2; log(log n) ; 2^(log n) ; n! ; n^3.
Ideal: log(log n);  2^(log n) ; n^2 ; n^3; n!
Response: 2^(log n)log(log n)n^2n^3n!

Question: briefly, how does selection sort work?
Ideal: it selects the minimum from an array and places it on the first position, then it selects the minimum from the rest of the array and places it on the second position, and so forth.
Response: it runs through the list and finds the smallest (or largest) value and puts it at the appropriate position

Question: what is the advantage of linked lists over arrays?
Ideal: linked lists are dynamic structures, which allow for a variable number of elements to be stored.
Response: linked lists have an indefinite size, whereas arrays are a specific size.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that stores elements following the first in first out principle. the main operations in a queue are enqueue and dequeue.
Response: its a lot like a stack, except that the first item put into the list is the first item to be taken from the list.

Question: what are the main operations associated with a stack?
Ideal: push and pop
Response: pop, push

Question: what is the euler tour traversal of a tree?
Ideal: a walk around the tree, starting with the root, where each node is seen three times: from the left, from below, from the right.
Response: it runs through the parents and the children in order 

Question: how do you delete a node from a binary search tree?
Ideal: find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtree (or the rightmost node from its left subtree).
Response: it all depends on where the node is located. if its a child it can just be deleted but for a node inside the tree it must be replaced with another node that works in its place.

Question: how many steps does it take to search a node in a binary search tree?
Ideal: the height of the tree.
Response: n, n being the number of nodes.

Question: what is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?
Ideal: to simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product. 
Response: a prototype program is a part of the specification phase of software problem solvin.  it's employed to illustrate how the key problem or problems will be solved in a program, and sometimes serves as a base program to expand upon.

Question: what stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage?
Ideal: the testing stage can influence both the coding stage (phase 5) and the solution refinement stage (phase 7) 
Response: directly: refining, coding.  because refining is right before the testing phase and coding is right after the testing phase.indirectly: production, maintenance.  because refining occurs before these last two stages in the software life cycle.

Question: what are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?
Ideal: abstraction and reusability.
Response: coding and debugging programs are usually easier, as either the compiler will specify the object that is working incorrectly, or the function an object was assigned to will be easier to identify.  the code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding.  post-programming maintenance is also easier.also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.   abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.  many of the smaller problems are shared between unique complex problems, and creating modules to these solve these smaller repeated problems can save time when you encounter them again.

Question: where do c++ programs begin to execute?
Ideal: at the main function.
Response: in the main function..?

Question: what is a variable?
Ideal: a location in memory that can store a value.
Response: a variable is a value that is subject to change in a computer's memory that can be used by programs.  programs can change the value of the variable and recall it later or act on it directly.

Question: where are variables declared in a c++ program?
Ideal: variables can be declared anywhere in a program. they can be declared inside a function (local variables) or outside the functions (global variables)
Response: in the main function, usually at the top of code.they can be declared almost anywhere, but must be declared before the code can use or act upon them.

Question: what is the main difference between a while and a do...while statement?
Ideal: the block inside a do...while statement will execute at least once.
Response: a do...while statement's body always executes at least once.  where as a while statement will not execute at all unless the condition for the while is true.

Question: what is typically included in a class definition?
Ideal: data members (attributes) and member functions.
Response: the data and methods 

Question: what is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?
Ideal: data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.
Response: local variables can only be used within the function, where as data members can be set to public access and can be used throughout

Question: what is the difference between a constructor and a function?
Ideal: a constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type.
Response: a constructor initializes data members but the functions actually perform tasks. constructors cant return values either. 

Question: when does c++ create a default constructor?
Ideal: if no constructor is provided, the compiler provides one by default. if a constructor is defined for a class, the compiler does not create a default constructor.
Response: when no constructor exists when one is needed, a parameterless default constructor is declared.

Question: how many constructors can be created for a class?
Ideal: unlimited number.
Response: it depends on the number of objects. each object should have a constructor.

Question: what is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?
Ideal: a function prototype includes the function signature, i.e., the name of the function, the return type, and the parameters' type. the function definition includes the actual body of the function. 
Response: a function prototype is just a declaration of the function existing, and cant be used as an actual function. a function has to be created with a definition within to tell the compiler what the function does.

Question: what is the role of a header-file?
Ideal: to store a class interface, including data members and member function prototypes.
Response: a header file is a file used to store a list of prototye functions and data members.

Question: what does a function signature include?
Ideal: the name of the function and the types of the parameters.
Response: a function signature includes the name of the function and types of arguments, but not the return type.

Question: what is the scope of global variables?
Ideal: file scope.
Response: global variables all have file scope.

Question: how does the compiler handle inline functions?
Ideal: it makes a copy of the function code in every place where a function call is made.
Response: for inline functions, the compiler creates a copy of the function's code in place so it doesn't have to make a function call and add to the function call stack.

Question: what is the main advantage associated with function arguments that are passed by reference? 
Ideal: it avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.
Response: if a function's arguments are large in size, computing time and memory space is not wasted copying down the argument and passing it to the function.  also pass by reference gives the function called the permission to read edit the argument directly.

Question: how are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?
Ideal: based on the function signature. when an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call.
Response: the compiler selects the right function to execute from the number, types and order of arguments in the function call.

Question: when defining a recursive function, what are possible causes for infinite recursion?
Ideal: if the recursion step is defined incorrectly, or if the base case is not included.
Response: if the recursion function never reaches or successfully defines the base case it will recurse forever.this happens many ways, such as the function doesn't progress towards the base case, or the function is coded poorly and doesn't even contain a base case.

Question: what are the similarities between iteration and recursion?
Ideal: they both involve repetition; they both have termination tests; they can both occur infinitely.
Response: iteration and recursion both use repetition and perform several simple operations and algorithms successively until they reach a certain limit.  so both involve a termination test to find that limit and both slowly approach that termination limit.  both are based on a control statement as well.  if coded poorly, both can continue on for forever until the compiler or the computer either locks up, shuts down or halts the operation.

Question: what are the two different ways of specifying the length of an array?
Ideal: in the array declaration, or by using an initializer list.
Response: you can use an initializer list, or simply tell the compiler how many elements you want in the array.for an initializer list: int a[] = {10, 2, 3, -4, 5};for an elemental declaration:int b[5];both arrays have 5 elements in them, but array a is already initialized.

Question: what is the main difference between strings declared using the type string versus strings declared using an array of characters?
Ideal: the strings declared using an array of characters have a null element added at the end of the array.
Response: the array of characters has a null character \0 at the end of the array to signify the array's end.  the string does not have this.

Question: how are arrays passed to functions?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: you pass the name of the array to the function.so for:int bin [10];you pass it to an array like so:jingle(bin);but jingle must be declared correctly in order to receive an array, either with prototypevoid jingle (int []);or with the definition in its initialization:void jingle (int array[]);it's also worth noting that arrays are passed to function by reference, so as to not copy large arrays over and over and burn memory.  this gives the function complete control over the array however.

Question: what is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?
Ideal: the arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program; that is, they are initialized only once, when the function that declares the array it is first called. 
Response: a static local array exists for the duration of the program and its elements are initialized to 0 if not explicitly initialized. so a static local array's elements will still be the same when called later unless specifically initialized to something else.  this doesn't happen for automatic arrays.

Question: how many dimensions need to be specified when passing a multi-dimensional array as an argument to a function?
Ideal: all the dimensions, except the first one. 
Response: all dimensions except for the first one need to be specified when passing an array to a function, the compiler needs to know how many memory addresses to skip to make it back to the 2nd element in the first dimension.  the size of the first dimension does not need to be specified.

Question: using an index outside the bounds of the array generates an error. is this a compilation error or a run-time error?
Ideal: run-time error.
Response: run-time error.

Question: what are the two different ways of specifying the length of an array?
Ideal: in the array declaration, or by using an initializer list.
Response: in a string you can specify with the strlen(arrayname) command. this gets the length of the string. another way is with integers where you initiate the size from the start, ex array[40] specifying a possible length of up to 40. then it is passed by an object the actual ammout in the array. another way is to declare it in an initializing program. 

Question: what is the main difference between strings declared using the type string versus strings declared using an array of characters?
Ideal: the strings declared using an array of characters have a null element added at the end of the array.
Response: strings with type string are just that. strings. they are not part of an array list at all where as one declared by an array is actually an array of characters able to be pointed and detected.

Question: how are arrays passed to functions?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: they are called by the function then the function must loop through the array to get the set of characters. 

Question: what is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?
Ideal: the arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program; that is, they are initialized only once, when the function that declares the array it is first called.

Question: how can you implement a queue with an array?
Ideal: use a circular array. keep the rear of the queue toward the end of the array, and the front toward the beginning, and allow the rear pointer to wrap around.
Response: using an array for a queue, the size of the array allocated limits the size of the queue. an array based queue class must keep track of both the front and back of the queue, which may need to wrap around the array.

Question: how can you implement a queue with a list?
Ideal: keep the rear of the queue pointing to the tail of the linked list, so the enqueue operation is done at the end of the list, and keep the front of the queue pointing to the head of the linked list, so the dequeue operation is done at the beginning of the list.

Question: what are the two main functions defined by a stack?
Ideal: push and pop
Response: pop function and push function

Question: how can you implement a stack with an array?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array.

Question: what operations would you need to perform to find a given element on a stack?
Ideal: pop all the elements and store them on another stack until the element is found, then push back all the elements on the original stack.
Response: using linked lists and stacks, you would need a temp stack to retain the values. then you would use the pop( ) function to pop off each element and then compare it. if its not the element your looking for, push ( ) it to the temp stack. repeat until the element is found. when you find it,  pop ( ) off the temp stack back onto the regular stack to have a complete stack again.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the last to be removed (or first-in-first-out).
Response: a queue stores a set of elements in a particular order.  its principle of operation is fifo(first in first out), which means the first element inserted is the first one to be removed.

Response: for applications in which a fixed-sized queue does not present a problem, you can use an array to represent a queue. 

Question: how can you implement a queue with a list?
Ideal: keep the rear of the queue pointing to the tail of the linked list, so the enqueue operation is done at the end of the list, and keep the front of the queue pointing to the head of the linked list, so the dequeue operation is done at the beginning of the list.
Response: you can use list to represent the items in a queue.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred for a queue, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)

Question: what is the difference between a constructor and a function?
Ideal: a constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type.
Response: constructors cannot return values, so they cannot specify a return type. normally, constructors are declared public.

Question: what is the main advantage associated with function arguments that are passed by reference? 
Ideal: it avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.
Response: pass by reference is good for performance reasons, because it can eliminate the pass by value overhead of copying large amounts of data.

Question: how are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?
Ideal: based on the function signature. when an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call.
Response: the compiler selects proper function to execute based on number, types and order of arguments in the function call.

Question: when defining a recursive function, what are possible causes for infinite recursion?

Response: arrays must be of a defined size... elements can be added to a linked list w/o defining any size.

Question: what is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?
Ideal: the elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal).

Ideal: keep the top of the stack pointing to the head of the linked list, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements at the beginning of the list.
Response: use the head as the top of the stack, only modify the head when you push/pop... push would add a new item to the head, pop would remove the item from the head.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: list-based because it does not use a fixed size like an array would.

Ideal: divide a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and then combine the solutions into a solution for the original problem.
Response: to divide and conquer, you divide the program in half once or multiple times to the extent that the program as a whole is easier to work in groups to solve the problem.

Question: briefly describe in one sentence how does merge sort work?
Ideal: it splits the original array into two, sorts each of the two halves, and then merges the sorted arrays.
Response: merge sort uses the "divide and conquer" idea where it divides the array in half multiple times and then joins each element of the array back into one sorted array. this is one of the best sorting algorithms besides quicksort.

Question: what is a pointer?

Ideal: log(log n);  2^(log n) ; n^2 ; n^3; n!
Response: log(log n) , 2^(log n) , n^2 , n^3, n!

Question: briefly, how does selection sort work?
Ideal: it selects the minimum from an array and places it on the first position, then it selects the minimum from the rest of the array and places it on the second position, and so forth.
Response: iterate through the list (assume list of integers), find the smallest one, and put it in a separate "sorted" list... then traverse again and find the next smallest, and move it to the sorted section... and repeat until you run out of elements to sort.

Question: what is the advantage of linked lists over arrays?
Ideal: linked lists are dynamic structures, which allow for a variable number of elements to be stored.
Response: linked lists do not have a definite size. they can be as big or as small as needed, and they don't have to allocate extra memory for elements you don't need. arrays size must be defined.

Ideal: data members (attributes) and member functions.
Response: it's specific class name, includes only information defined by that class... implementation details... etc.

Question: what is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?
Ideal: data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.
Response: a data member is part of a c++ class or structure that stores data of a certain type... a local variable inside a member function is only available inside that function, and can be used to derive a desired outcome.

Question: what is the difference between a constructor and a function?
Ideal: a constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type.
Response: a constructor is a method that starts new instances of a class. (example: employee employee1(parameters) starts a new instance of object of type employee). a function is simply a module w/in a program that completes its single desired task.

Ideal: it makes a copy of the function code in every place where a function call is made.
Response: you declare your inline function in the header or before your int main(). you then can call that function at anytime in your main program quickly and easily.

Question: what is the main advantage associated with function arguments that are passed by reference? 
Ideal: it avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.
Response: you do not alter the original value of the variable that was passed.

Question: how are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?
Ideal: based on the function signature. when an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call.
Response: by the type they are initilized with (int, char, etc.)

Ideal: if the recursion step is defined incorrectly, or if the base case is not included.
Response: not having a base case that returns a base value.

Question: what are the similarities between iteration and recursion?
Ideal: they both involve repetition; they both have termination tests; they can both occur infinitely.
Response: both rely on repetition, both have a base case, both can become an infinite loop. anything recursive can also be solved with iteration.

Question: how are arrays passed to functions?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: you must pass the array and its size to the function. ex. function(array, size);

Question: what is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?
Ideal: the arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program; that is, they are initialized only once, when the function that declares the array it is first called. 
Response: a static array will only be initilized once, a non static array will be re-initilized once the program reaches the initilization line again.

Response: a list of nodes where each node contains a data member and also a pointer to the next node.

Question: what is the main advantage of linked lists over arrays?
Ideal: the linked lists can be of variable length.
Response: the principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the order of the linked items may be different from the order that the data items are stored in memory or on disk, allowing the list of items to be traversed in a different order. a linked list is a self-referential datatype because it contains a pointer or link to another datum of the same type. linked lists permit insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list in constant time

Question: what is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?
Ideal: the elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal).
Response: on the other hand, arrays allow random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. singly-linked lists, in fact, can only be traversed in one direction.

Question: how are linked lists passed as arguments to a function?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: you send a pointer to an object of the linkedlist class

Question: what is the difference between a circular linked list and a basic linked list?

Ideal: push and pop
Response: push (insert an item)pop (remove an item)

Question: how can you implement a stack with an array?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array.

Question: how can you implement a stack with a list?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack pointing to the head of the linked list, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements at the beginning of the list.
Response: you implement a stack with a list by changing the pointer to the first element of the list to the new item and move the pointer from the top of the stack to the next item when removing an item.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: usually linked list because it doesn't have a fixed size. but if you know or want to set a max size array is better.

Question: how are infix expressions evaluated by computers?
Ideal: first, they are converted into postfix form, followed by an evaluation of the postfix expression.
Response: computers usually convert infix expressions to post fix expression and evaluate them using a stack.

Question: what operations would you need to perform to find a given element on a stack?
Ideal: pop all the elements and store them on another stack until the element is found, then push back all the elements on the original stack.
Response: if the stack is implemented using an array you could simply search the array for the item. if the stack is implemented using a linked list you would have to pop the values off of the stack until either the value is found or the stack is empty, you would then have to have the items put back into the list.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the last to be removed (or first-in-first-out).
Response: last in, last out architecture. it works the same way a line at the bank would work, the person that's been waiting the longest gets served first.

Question: what are the two main functions defined by a queue?
Ideal: enqueue and dequeue
Response: enqueue and dequeue

Question: how can you implement a queue with an array?
Ideal: use a circular array. keep the rear of the queue toward the end of the array, and the front toward the beginning, and allow the rear pointer to wrap around.
Response: declare the size of an array, and have special conditional statements (pointers) to make sure you re-use all of the array. say, you have an array of 20 elements, you load up 18, then dequeue 3, when you enqueue 4 more elements, you want to loop back to index 0 and continue from there... this process saves resources.

Question: how can you implement a queue with a list?
Ideal: keep the rear of the queue pointing to the tail of the linked list, so the enqueue operation is done at the end of the list, and keep the front of the queue pointing to the head of the linked list, so the dequeue operation is done at the beginning of the list.
Response: enqueue to the end of the linked list... dequeue items from the beginning (head) of the list.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred for a queue, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)

Question: what is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?
Ideal: to simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product. 
Response: high risk problems are address in the prototype program to make sure that the program is feasible.  a prototype may also be used to show a company that the software can be possibly programmed.

Question: what stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage?
Ideal: the testing stage can influence both the coding stage (phase 5) and the solution refinement stage (phase 7) 
Response: refining and possibly the design if the testing phase reveals problems in the design. production can be affected if the program is unworkable in its current form which will lead to a later production time than originally estimated. also affects coding because after testing you may need to rewrite the code for the program to remove errors.

Question: what are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?
Ideal: abstraction and reusability.
Response: modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug. good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code. also allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism.

Ideal: push and pop
Response: push and pop are two main functions defined in a stack

Question: how can you implement a stack with an array?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array.
Response: an array has a fixed size.  you can add and delete elements to the end of the array and you use a pointer to keep track of the last element added.  each time you add or delete an element you update the pointer and check if it is equal to the max size of the array.

Ideal: data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.
Response: a data member is a more general term describing all objects instantiated within a member function.  "local" in local variables refers more to the scope of a variable, which may be located in anything from a control structure to a class.  local variables whose scope are in a member function are the same as data members of member functions.

Response: linked lists have an indefinite size. they can be added to and taken away from very easily with little difficulty in the shifting of data.

Question: what is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?
Ideal: the elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal).
Response: arrays have a set list of values. meaning you can pick a spot in the array such as a[7] picks the 8th spot in the array. with linked lists you have to keep track with pointers if you want to take specific nodes out, otherwise you must traverse the entire list.

Response: linked lists are very dynamic in that they can change and be added/subtracted to very easily because they are not linear in memory.  arrays are pre-specified in size to be cast over a certain amount of disk space.  this makes insertion into arrays difficult because all elements must be shifted, and if you reach the end of the array, you are done even if you have more data to input.  linked lists do not run into these problems.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that stores elements following the first in first out principle. the main operations in a queue are enqueue and dequeue.
Response: a queue is a first in first out data structure much like a line for a movie theatre.  the first object in line is the first object to be handled or enacted upon.  

Question: what are the main operations associated with a stack?
Ideal: push and pop
Response: push, pop, isempty, isfullmaybe list to show all elements or an operation to count how many elements in the stack.

Question: what is the euler tour traversal of a tree?
Ideal: a walk around the tree, starting with the root, where each node is seen three times: from the left, from below, from the right.
Response: the euler tour traversal of a tree is a specific way of navigating a tree that involves following the tree starting at the very top and moving along the left side of the tree first, cupping in to visit the parents of children nodes.  it allows for each node to be visited from the left, the right and the bottom.the euler tour first progresses to a left child if there is one, then progresses to it's parent, then it's next child, then it's parent's parent.

Question: how do you delete a node from a binary search tree?
Ideal: find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtree (or the rightmost node from its left subtree).
Response: in a binary search tree, you must first establish a proper replacement for the node you are about to delete, usually a child from the soon to be deleted node.  once that replacement node has been found, you simply reassign it to where the node that is going to be deleted is.  after the deleted node has been usurped, you remove the deleted node from memory so it may be used again.

Question: how many steps does it take to search a node in a binary search tree?
Ideal: the height of the tree.
Response: if the binary search tree is constructed efficiently, best case scenario is o(log n) time.  where n is the number of items in the tree.if the binary search tree is constructed poorly, with for instance the root of the tree being 1, and progressing downwards and to the right its children are each more than the last: you have a one-way linear linked list.  that worse case scenario would be a full traversal at o(n) time. where n is the number of items in the tree.

Question: what stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage?
Ideal: the testing stage can influence both the coding stage (phase 5) and the solution refinement stage (phase 7) 
Response: the implementation phase and the maintenance phase are effected

Question: what are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?
Ideal: abstraction and reusability.
Response: this type of programming is more flexible, making it easier to add and modify the program.  it is also a type of a fail safe program, you check each individual module.  this eliminates redundant code and makes the program easier to read for other programmers.  when debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program.

Question: where do c++ programs begin to execute?
Ideal: at the main function.
Response: the function main().

Question: what is a variable?
Ideal: a location in memory that can store a value.
Response: in programming, a structure that holds data and is uniquely named by the programmer. it holds the data assigned to it until a new value is assigned or the program is finished.

Question: where are variables declared in a c++ program?
Ideal: variables can be declared anywhere in a program. they can be declared inside a function (local variables) or outside the functions (global variables)
Response: in the function main() before using the variable.

Question: what is the main difference between a while and a do...while statement?
Ideal: the block inside a do...while statement will execute at least once.
Response: do...while statements evaluate whether or not to loop after running the block contained within it at least once. so the main differance is that while statements have a possibility of never being used. do ... while statements on the other hand are always run at least once before evaluating whether to run again.

Question: what is typically included in a class definition?
Ideal: data members (attributes) and member functions.
Response: the attributes of said class. also whether or not it is a subclass. also whether it is public private or protected.

Question: what is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?
Ideal: data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.
Response:  a field variable is a variable that is declared as a member of a class. a local variable is avariable that isdeclared local to a method.

Question: what is the difference between a constructor and a function?
Ideal: a constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type.
Response: all constructors are functions but not all functions are constructors. also functions can have nearly infinite purposes, while constructors always create an instance of whichever class you are using. you can change how a constructor does something but not what it does. with functions you can change not only the how but also the what.

Question: when does c++ create a default constructor?
Ideal: if no constructor is provided, the compiler provides one by default. if a constructor is defined for a class, the compiler does not create a default constructor.
Response: during compilation

Question: how many constructors can be created for a class?
Ideal: unlimited number.
Response: as many as you want so long as they have different parameters.

Question: what is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?
Ideal: a function prototype includes the function signature, i.e., the name of the function, the return type, and the parameters' type. the function definition includes the actual body of the function. 
Response: the function prototype is where the programmer declares that he/she is using a function other than main( ). this is like declaring a variable, the programmer knows that he/she will be using in the future, but has yet to say where they are going to use it, or how. this is answers the question who, it gives the function a name and character. the function prototype, by common practice is placed at the beginning of the program after the #includes and before main( ).the function definition is the guts of the function. this is where the programmer decides what the function is going to do and tells it how to do it. it takes whatever information it is given and performs the operations. it works sort of like the brain, the brain takes in input and based upon that input performs in some way producing an output. the function defintion is placed outside of main( ) and any other functions. a function is its own entity and should be thought of as such.

Question: what is the role of a header-file?
Ideal: to store a class interface, including data members and member function prototypes.
Response: the main role of header file is it is used to share information among various files.

Question: what does a function signature include?
Ideal: the name of the function and the types of the parameters.
Response: it includes the specific information about the function such as input and output variable types and how many of each.

Question: what is the scope of global variables?
Ideal: file scope.
Response: they can be accessed by any c++ file anywhere.

Question: how does the compiler handle inline functions?
Ideal: it makes a copy of the function code in every place where a function call is made.
Response: when the compiler inline-expands a function call, the function's code gets inserted into the caller's code stream (conceptually similar to what happens with a #define macro). this can, depending on a zillion other things, improve performance, because the optimizer can procedurally integrate the called code  optimize the called code into the caller. 

Question: what is the main advantage associated with function arguments that are passed by reference? 
Ideal: it avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.
Response: because you can't change the original and passing by reference limits memory needed for the program.

Question: how are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?
Ideal: based on the function signature. when an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call.
Response: they differentiated by the compiler by the conditions/inputs used for one of the overloaded functions.

Question: when defining a recursive function, what are possible causes for infinite recursion?
Ideal: if the recursion step is defined incorrectly, or if the base case is not included.
Response: badly designed algorithyms. using recursion for a non recursive problem.

Question: what are the similarities between iteration and recursion?
Ideal: they both involve repetition; they both have termination tests; they can both occur infinitely.
Response: as discussed earlier, recursion may be used to process iterative actions. recursion is used for calculations where the answer can be described in a function that relates to itself.

Question: what are the two different ways of specifying the length of an array?
Ideal: in the array declaration, or by using an initializer list.
Response: by either inputing the different elements in the array at coding or giving the array specifacations as to the size of the array. it is also possible when giving it specifacations to tell the array to grow as needed.

Question: what is the main difference between strings declared using the type string versus strings declared using an array of characters?
Ideal: the strings declared using an array of characters have a null element added at the end of the array.
Response: the type string uses less storage and you have to change the string all at once. with an array of characters you can make permutations of words using the characters stored in the array, without needing to actually access and change the variables. with an array of characters you can just change how they're accessed.

Question: how are arrays passed to functions?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: a reference pointer to an element in the array.

Question: what is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?
Ideal: the arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program; that is, they are initialized only once, when the function that declares the array it is first called. 
Response: a static array can only be referenced not accessed. also static arrays can be used without creating an object.

Question: how many dimensions need to be specified when passing a multi-dimensional array as an argument to a function?
Ideal: all the dimensions, except the first one.

Response: compilation error.

Question: how are bi-dimensional arrays stored in memory, by rows or by columns?
Ideal: by rows.
Response: by rows.

Question: in one sentence, what is the main idea implemented by insertion sort?
Ideal: taking one array element at a time, from left to right, it inserts it in the right position among the already sorted elements on its left. 
Response: insertion sort divides the list into sorted and unsorted regions, then takes each item from the unsorted region and inserts it into its correct order in the sorted region.

Question: in one sentence, what is the main idea implemented by selection sort?
Ideal: taking one array element at a time, from left to right, it identifies the minimum from the remaining elements and swaps it with the current element.
Response: selection sort searches the whole array for the largest item and puts it at the end of the array, then searches for the second largest item and puts it at the second to last spot and so on.

Question: what is the number of operations for insertion sort under a best-case scenario, and what is the best-case scenario?
Ideal: n (the length of the array) operations achieved for a sorted array.
Response: insertion sort is o(n) and performs n-1 operations in the best-case scenario, which is when the list or array is already sorted.

Question: what is the base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort?
Ideal: when the size of the array to be sorted is 1 (or 2)
Response: the base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort is when the sequence being passed to merge sort has less than 2 elements.

Ideal: an alias (synonym) for the name of the object that its operand points to in memory. it is the dereferencing operator.
Response: the star operator returns a synonym for the object to which its pointer operand points.

Question: how can an array be addressed in pointer/offset notation?
Ideal: by initializing a pointer to point to the first element of the array, and then incrementing this pointer with the index of the array element.
Response: an array can be addressed in pointer/offset notation by setting a pointer variable equal to the variable name of the array. elements of the array can then be accessed by adding an offset value to the pointer variable.

Question: what does the sizeof operator return?
Ideal: the size in bytes of its operand.
Response: the sizeof operator returns the size of the operand.

Question: what are the different ways to pass a pointer to a function?
Ideal: there are four ways: nonconstant pointer to constant data, nonconstant pointer to nonconstant data, constant pointer to constant data, constant pointer to nonconstant data.
Response: nonconstant pointer to nonconstant data, nonconstant pointer to constant data, constant pointer to nonconstant data, constant pointer to constant data.

Question: what is a function pointer?
Ideal: the address of the location in memory where the function code resides.
Response: a function pointer is a pointer that contains the address of the  function in memory.

Question: what is the main advantage of linked lists over arrays?
Ideal: the linked lists can be of variable length.
Response: unlike arrays, linked lists can insert and delete without shifting data and change in size easily.

Question: what is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?
Ideal: the elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal).
Response: arrays require less memory than linked lists and allow direct access to a specified item. also, insertion and deletion in arrays does not require a list traversal.

Question: how are linked lists passed as arguments to a function?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: linked lists are passed as arguments to a function by passing the head pointer of the list by reference.

Question: what is the difference between a circular linked list and a basic linked list?
Ideal: the last element in a circular linked list points to the head of the list.
Response: in a circular linked list, every node has a successor which means that the last node's successor is the head or first node.

Question: what is the main advantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?
Ideal: all the deletion and insertion operations can be performed in constant time, including those operations performed before a given location in the list or at the end of the list.
Response: in a doubly linked list you can delete a node without having to traverse the list.

Question: what is the main disadvantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?
Ideal: extra space required to store the back pointers.
Response: in a doubly linked list, there are more pointers to set and the mechanics of inserting and deleting are more difficult. also, the special cases at the beginning or end of the list are more complicated.

Question: what is a stack?
Ideal: a data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the first to be removed (or last-in-first-out)
Response: a stack is an abstract data type that is based on the principle that the last element inserted into the stack will be the first element removed from the stack.

Question: what are the two main functions defined by a stack?
Ideal: push and pop
Response: push which inserts an element on the top of the stack and pop which removes the last inserted element from the stack.

Question: how can you implement a stack with an array?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array.
Response: by implementing an array of a pre-defined size with the bottom stack element stored at element 0 and the last element stored in the array is the top. you increment top when an element is pushed and you decrement it when an item is popped.

Question: how can you implement a stack with a list?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack pointing to the head of the linked list, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements at the beginning of the list.
Response: you implement a list in which the head pointer points to the element most recently pushed onto the list and the pop function changes the head pointer to point to the next to last element in the list and removes the element head pointer previously pointed to.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: list based is preferred because the stack you create is not limited in size and can increase or decrease in size as needed.

Question: how are infix expressions evaluated by computers?
Ideal: first, they are converted into postfix form, followed by an evaluation of the postfix expression.
Response: they are first converted to postfix expressions and then evaluated.

Question: what operations would you need to perform to find a given element on a stack?
Ideal: pop all the elements and store them on another stack until the element is found, then push back all the elements on the original stack.
Response: you would have to keep using peek or gettop to see what the top element is then popping the top element until peek or gettop provides the element you are looking for.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the last to be removed (or first-in-first-out).
Response: a queue is a list of objects in a particular order that is read one at a time starting at the first followed by the second and so on.

Question: what are the two main functions defined by a queue?
Ideal: enqueue and dequeue
Response: enqueue , which inserts a specified element at the head of the specified queue, and dequeue , which removes the specified element from the queue.

Question: how can you implement a queue with an array?
Ideal: use a circular array. keep the rear of the queue toward the end of the array, and the front toward the beginning, and allow the rear pointer to wrap around.
Response: you create an array with the max size of your queue and adjust the items to make them follow fifo procedure.

Question: how can you implement a queue with a list?
Ideal: keep the rear of the queue pointing to the tail of the linked list, so the enqueue operation is done at the end of the list, and keep the front of the queue pointing to the head of the linked list, so the dequeue operation is done at the beginning of the list.
Response: theoretically you could do it two ways one of which uses more processing power and memory no larger than the queue is ever at when full and the other which uses almost infinite memory. the more practical method would be two place the items in an array and remove the item in position one of the array after which you can shift the array and add another element if required. the other option which can use infinite memory when used for long term queues such as job scheduling that goes nonstop for extended periods. that is to implement an array and add the items read item one raise your counter value to two ecetera and continue adding more elements to the array. the downside to this method is after you use element one it is still in memory. or im crazy who knows

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred for a queue, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: linked list based. because it doesn't store the items linearly in memory but instead as individual blocks.

Question: what is the stack operation corresponding to the enqueue operation in queues?
Ideal: push
Response: push, which inserts something at the top of the stack.

Question: what data structure is more appropriate for scheduling printing jobs at a printer, a stack or a queue?
Ideal: queue

Question: what is the height of a tree?
Ideal: the length of the longest path from the root to any of its leaves.
Response: the height of a tree is in terms of the levels of its nodes such that, if  the tree is empty its height is 0 otherwise its height is equal to the maximum level of its nodes.

Question: what is a leaf?
Ideal: a node that has no children.
Response: a leaf is a node with no children.

Question: what is a binary tree?
Ideal: a tree for which the maximum number of children per node is two.
Response: a binary tree is a set of nodes that is either empty or partitioned into a root node and one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root. each node can have no more than two children, a right and a left child.

Question: what is a binary search tree?
Ideal: a binary tree that has the property that for any node the left child is smaller than the parent which in turn is smaller than the right child.
Response: a binary search tree is a binary tree where the value in any node 'n' is greater than the value in every node in n's left subtree but less than every node in n's right subtree.

Question: what is the inorder traversal of a binary tree?
Ideal: traverse the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
Response: the inorder traversal of a binary tree visits the node of a binary tree in order according to their data values.

Question: how many comparisons does it take to find an element in a binary search tree?

Question: what is the difference between an array that is declared as static and one that is not?
Ideal: the static arrays are intialized only once when the function is called.
Response: a static array only has a specific size and it cannot grow. also static arrays cannot be accessed outside the program which created it.

Question: what is the main difference between a string of characters that is read into a variable of type string versus a variable of type char[]?
Ideal: the char[] will automatically add a null \0 character at the end of the string.
Response: a variable char is basically any non command key on the keyboard that you can press. a string is a collection of letters or numbers that is stored together to be used later. comonly strings are used for words. chars can be used for less but can have opperations performed on them in a useful way.

Question: briefly describe the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
Ideal: divide a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and then combine the solutions into a solution for the original problem.
Response: divide and coquer means dividing a problem into 2+ problems which are solved and then merged  back together for a final solution to the whole problem.

Question: briefly describe in one sentence how does merge sort work?
Ideal: it splits the original array into two, sorts each of the two halves, and then merges the sorted arrays.
Response: a merge sort works by removing all items to sepperate memory locations and merging them back together in order.

Ideal: data members (attributes) and member functions.
Response: information telling the compiler what data members and member functions belong to the class.

Question: what is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?
Ideal: data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.
Response: data members are declared inside the class, but outside of any member functions. unlike with local variables, each object of the class keeps its own copy of the data members stored in memory.

Question: what is the difference between a constructor and a function?
Ideal: a constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type.
Response: unlike regular functions, constructors are only used to initialize an objects data when it is created. constructors must also be given the same name as the class and cannot return any values.

Ideal: file scope.
Response: global variables have file scope.

Question: how does the compiler handle inline functions?
Ideal: it makes a copy of the function code in every place where a function call is made.

Ideal: it avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.
Response: passing by reference can eliminate the pass-by-value overhead of copying large amounts of data.

Question: how are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?
Ideal: based on the function signature. when an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call.

Ideal: by initializing a pointer to point to the first element of the array, and then incrementing this pointer with the index of the array element.
Response: the pointer to the array will initially point to the first element of that array.  when the pointer is incremented, it will point to the next element, and so on.

Question: what does the sizeof operator return?
Ideal: the size in bytes of its operand.
Response: sizeof returns the size in bytes of the respective object.

Question: what are the different ways to pass a pointer to a function?

Question: what is a linked list?
Ideal: a collection of elements that can be allocated dynamically.
Response: a linked list is a data structure containing one or more data elements with a pointer to the next node.

Question: what is the main advantage of linked lists over arrays?
Ideal: the linked lists can be of variable length.
Response: linked lists can be grown dynamically, items don't require shifting, and they have a greater awesome factor than that of arrays.

Question: what is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?
Ideal: the elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal).
Response: arrays, being fixed, are less error prone.

Question: how are linked lists passed as arguments to a function?
Ideal: by reference.
Response: the linked list object contains the head, through which the other elements are accessible.

Question: what is the difference between a circular linked list and a basic linked list?
Ideal: the last element in a circular linked list points to the head of the list.
Response: the circular linked list's tail points to the head, whereas the basic linked list's tail points to a null.

Question: what is the main advantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?
Ideal: all the deletion and insertion operations can be performed in constant time, including those operations performed before a given location in the list or at the end of the list.
Response: doubly linked lists allow backward movement through the nodes.

Question: what is the main disadvantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?
Ideal: extra space required to store the back pointers.
Response: each node requires an extra pointer (space requirements increased), insertion or deletion of a node takes a longer (more pointer operations).

Question: what are the two main functions defined by a stack?
Ideal: push and pop
Response: push and pop.

Question: how can you implement a stack with an array?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array.
Response: use an index value called top to keep track of the last element in the array.

Question: how can you implement a stack with a list?
Ideal: keep the top of the stack pointing to the head of the linked list, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements at the beginning of the list.
Response: use head as the top and push and pop nodes from the head.

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: list-based, as the list can be grown dynamically, and as the head node is easily accessible.

Question: how are infix expressions evaluated by computers?
Ideal: first, they are converted into postfix form, followed by an evaluation of the postfix expression.
Response: by throwing variables into a postfix expression and operands onto a parentheses regulated stack until end parentheses and enough variables to operate on are encountered. 

Question: what operations would you need to perform to find a given element on a stack?
Ideal: pop all the elements and store them on another stack until the element is found, then push back all the elements on the original stack.
Response: keep popping nodes and storing them in an alternate stack until the given element is found, then pop the given element and push the previously popped nodes back onto the stack.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the last to be removed (or first-in-first-out).
Response: a queue is a first in first out data structure.

Ideal: enqueue and dequeue
Response: enqueue and dequeue

Question: how can you implement a queue with an array?
Ideal: use a circular array. keep the rear of the queue toward the end of the array, and the front toward the beginning, and allow the rear pointer to wrap around.
Response: add in data from the first element to the last, take out data from the first element to the last.

Question: how can you implement a queue with a list?
Ideal: keep the rear of the queue pointing to the tail of the linked list, so the enqueue operation is done at the end of the list, and keep the front of the queue pointing to the head of the linked list, so the dequeue operation is done at the beginning of the list.
Response: throw in data at the head and take it out at the tail

Question: which implementation (array-based vs. list-based) is preferred for a queue, and why?
Ideal: link-based, because they are dynamic (no size constraints)
Response: queue's are best with lists, especially if the tail is kept track of, as the list can be dynamically grown without losing track of the head or tail.

Question: what is the stack operation corresponding to the enqueue operation in queues?
Ideal: push
Response: push

Question: what data structure is more appropriate for scheduling printing jobs at a printer, a stack or a queue?
Ideal: queue
Response: queue's are more appropriate, as printers are usually first come, first serve.  

Question: what is a tree?
Ideal: a collection of nodes, which has a special node called root, and the rest of the nodes are partitioned into one or more disjoint sets, each set being a tree.
Response: it is a list of numbers in a list made by comparing values of nodes already in the tree and adding to the appropriate spot. its a list made up of nodes with left and right pointers.

Question: what is the height of a tree?
Ideal: the length of the longest path from the root to any of its leaves.
Response: the intensity of the children. say you begin with one node, thats one height. then you add two children to that node and then two children to each of those nodes and two children to each of those nodes. youre current height would be 4.

Question: what is a leaf?
Ideal: a node that has no children.
Response: the last value in the tree. a value with no children attatched. 

Question: what is a binary tree?
Ideal: a tree for which the maximum number of children per node is two.
Response: a list of numbers that are ordered compared to how they compare to the other numbers already added in the tree

Question: what is a binary search tree?
Ideal: a binary tree that has the property that for any node the left child is smaller than the parent which in turn is smaller than the right child.
Response: a tree that is set up so that it can be easily searched for numbers based on the location compared to the previous nodes.

Ideal: through iteration.
Response: iteration

Question: what is the difference between an array that is declared as static and one that is not?
Ideal: the static arrays are intialized only once when the function is called.
Response: static arrays cannot be changed while normal arrays can be changed

Question: what is the main difference between a string of characters that is read into a variable of type string versus a variable of type char[]?
Ideal: the char[] will automatically add a null \0 character at the end of the string.
Response: character arrays can call on individual letters were a string array can only call words.

Question: briefly describe the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
Ideal: divide a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and then combine the solutions into a solution for the original problem.
Response: take a problem and divide it into a smaller problem and solve that smaller problem, or divide it into a smaller problem and solve it, thus solving the whole problem in the process.

Question: briefly describe in one sentence how does merge sort work?
Ideal: it splits the original array into two, sorts each of the two halves, and then merges the sorted arrays.
Response: take an array and split it into two, then solve these simpler problems and merge the two answers in correct order.

Response: from least to greatest:  log(log n), 2^(log n), n^2, n^3, n!

Question: briefly, how does selection sort work?
Ideal: it selects the minimum from an array and places it on the first position, then it selects the minimum from the rest of the array and places it on the second position, and so forth.
Response: selection sort iterates through the array one element at a time, seeking the least value from the right and replacing the current value with it.

Question: what is the advantage of linked lists over arrays?
Ideal: linked lists are dynamic structures, which allow for a variable number of elements to be stored.
Response: linked lists may be dynamically grown.

Question: what is a queue?
Ideal: a data structure that stores elements following the first in first out principle. the main operations in a queue are enqueue and dequeue.

Question: how do you delete a node from a binary search tree?
Ideal: find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtree (or the rightmost node from its left subtree).
Response: if the node is a leaf, just set it's parent's pointer to null and delete it, if it has a single child, set the parent's pointer to the child and delete; if it has two children, set the node to one of the middle children and remove that child from its previous position as a leaf (rightmost child of the left subtree or leftmost child of the right subtree).
