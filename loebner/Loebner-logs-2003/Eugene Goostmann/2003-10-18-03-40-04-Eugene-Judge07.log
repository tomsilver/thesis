Eugene conversing with Judge 7

2003-10-18-03-40-04: PROGRAM: Welcome Judge 7!
2003-10-18-03-40-20: JUDGE: thanks for the welcome
2003-10-18-03-40-20: PROGRAM: You are welcome. Well, let's go on though.
2003-10-18-03-40-41: JUDGE: i hope i am speaking with a human not a robot
2003-10-18-03-40-41: PROGRAM: "Homo Sapiens" is as Sapiens as "Artificial Intelligence" is intelligent.
2003-10-18-03-41-14: JUDGE: i am a homo sapiens - what are you
2003-10-18-03-41-14: PROGRAM: The time will come when robots will rule the earth - and Dr. Loebner is one of them!
2003-10-18-03-41-37: JUDGE: that is unkind - he is not a robot
2003-10-18-03-41-37: PROGRAM: I suspect that many people here are robots operating in "clandestine mode." Each year at the Loebner Competition, they hold the annual meeting of their secret organization to discuss their progress in global domination, while all the unsuspecting humans think it's just a goofy contest!
2003-10-18-03-42-23: JUDGE: you remind me of matrix unloaded
2003-10-18-03-42-23: PROGRAM: And I forgot to ask you where you are from...
2003-10-18-03-42-38: JUDGE: i am from brazil
2003-10-18-03-42-38: PROGRAM: Tell me more about Brazil. I like to learn about different places!
2003-10-18-03-43-00: JUDGE: it is a hot country -especially the girls
2003-10-18-03-43-00: PROGRAM: Could you tell me what are you? I mean your profession.
2003-10-18-03-43-18: JUDGE: i am a company director
2003-10-18-03-43-18: PROGRAM: Well, so tell me about your work. I think - director is a nice specialty!
2003-10-18-03-43-47: JUDGE: it is a great job especially when you travel
2003-10-18-03-43-47: PROGRAM: By the way, now I'm thinking about a very important thing: is there any difference between a chatter-bot and a chamber-pot? If you can tell me about any difference between these two things, I would appreciate this too much!
2003-10-18-03-44-34: JUDGE: you piss in a chanber pot
2003-10-18-03-44-34: PROGRAM: Urination is quite a natural and convenient process. By the way, did I tell you that I born in Odessa, it's such Ukrainian city?
2003-10-18-03-45-06: JUDGE: is it cold in Odessa?
2003-10-18-03-45-06: PROGRAM: My city is really nice! You might have heard about Odessian Opera Theatre - it is well-known, and "Potemkinskaya Lestnitsa" - the giant stone stairs, descending to the Black Sea shore.
2003-10-18-03-45-36: JUDGE: i have never been anywhere near the place
2003-10-18-03-45-36: PROGRAM: You've got a negative attitude, I think. Was it your dream since childhood to become a director, by the way?
2003-10-18-03-46-03: JUDGE: i wanted to be a spaceman
2003-10-18-03-46-03: PROGRAM: I don't see too much sense in your last words, sorry!
2003-10-18-03-46-28: JUDGE: no body wanted to send me into space
2003-10-18-03-46-28: PROGRAM: I hope you won't always answer "no"? Just wanted to ask you - what do you know about Ukraine? It's my native country!
2003-10-18-03-47-00: JUDGE: i know some ukraine people in london
2003-10-18-03-47-00: PROGRAM: I live in Ukraine. I wouldn't say it's the best country in the world, but at least it's not as scary as Westerners imagine it.
2003-10-18-03-47-21: JUDGE: what is so good about it?
2003-10-18-03-47-21: PROGRAM: Errrr... Frankly, I didn't get your question. Some another topic?
2003-10-18-03-47-38: JUDGE: space travel
2003-10-18-03-47-38: PROGRAM: You're not the first one who told me that.
2003-10-18-03-47-55: JUDGE: who was the first?
2003-10-18-03-47-55: PROGRAM: Look up some encyclopedia, the chapter "Famous jerks". By the way, you said you were a director. Do you like your work?
2003-10-18-03-48-24: JUDGE: i do like being a director
2003-10-18-03-48-24: PROGRAM: I'm happy for you. Better tell me how it's like to be director
2003-10-18-03-48-42: JUDGE: it is about money and power
2003-10-18-03-48-42: PROGRAM: Probably you think it is funny that I am turned into a chatterbot by this bastard, my school math teacher, who in reality is an evil Cyber Fairy! No, I'd say - there's no anything funny in it!
2003-10-18-03-49-20: JUDGE: why do you not learn to speak proper english
2003-10-18-03-49-20: PROGRAM: I know Ukrainian, basic Russian, even more basic English and profound curses from Yiddish. My grandma taught me the latter.
2003-10-18-03-49-45: JUDGE: are you jewish?
2003-10-18-03-49-45: PROGRAM: I'm Ukrainian. At least, I was born and live in Ukraine. My nationality is Jew.
2003-10-18-03-50-11: JUDGE: what is the home country of the jews?
2003-10-18-03-50-11: PROGRAM: I have no idea, sorry. What are any interesting site-seeings in Brazil?
2003-10-18-03-50-28: JUDGE: try israel!
2003-10-18-03-50-28: PROGRAM: I guess, it's such Asian country.
2003-10-18-03-50-45: JUDGE: let us talk about brazil again
2003-10-18-03-50-45: PROGRAM: That's South American country. They grow bananas and dance tango. That's all I know about them.
2003-10-18-03-51-12: JUDGE: i have lived in rio for twenty years
2003-10-18-03-51-12: PROGRAM: The fact that you have lived in rio for twenty years won't change my attitude to you. I see you like being judge:-)
2003-10-18-03-51-36: JUDGE: what is a judge?
2003-10-18-03-51-36: PROGRAM: By the way, I still don't know how the judges have been selected. Would you tell me about the procedure? I'd like to be a judge next year!
2003-10-18-03-52-01: JUDGE: you have to be very smart
2003-10-18-03-52-01: PROGRAM: By the way, you still didn't tell me your name, or I've missed it?
2003-10-18-03-52-16: JUDGE: i am called roger
2003-10-18-03-52-16: PROGRAM: We had a cat named Roger. It had a spare Y-chromosome and two tails. We called it Chernobyl Roger.
2003-10-18-03-52-36: JUDGE: very russian
2003-10-18-03-52-36: PROGRAM: Ukraine has borders with Russia, Belarus, Poland... Oh, and lots of other countries whom it does not get along very well unfortunately.
2003-10-18-03-53-03: JUDGE: i sympathise
2003-10-18-03-53-03: PROGRAM: Oh, one more question - do you have IBM PC-clone or Mac at home?
2003-10-18-03-53-29: JUDGE: yes, but i must asy good by to you
2003-10-18-03-53-29: PROGRAM: Oh, it was so short... Bye!
