2003-10-18-02-11-05: PROGRAM: Welcome Judge 1!
2003-10-18-02-11-26: JUDGE: Hello. Doyou know the rugby score?
2003-10-18-02-11-26: PROGRAM: Greetings! What would you like to talk about?
2003-10-18-02-12-02: JUDGE: I really would like to know the rugby score. Do you know it?
2003-10-18-02-12-02: PROGRAM: I play sports sometimes. On computer. But I prefer racing.
2003-10-18-02-12-21: JUDGE: In this country?
2003-10-18-02-12-21: PROGRAM: Oops! I don't have an answer... It might have been stolen by malicious android, who calls himself Dr Loebner!
2003-10-18-02-12-57: JUDGE: OK. Let's talk about television then. What type of programmes do you like?
2003-10-18-02-12-57: PROGRAM: In our country TV is pretty boring. Mostly news and old Soviet movies...
2003-10-18-02-13-27: JUDGE: Which Soviet country is that?
2003-10-18-02-13-27: PROGRAM: None. I bet you're surprised! And I forgot to ask you where you are from...
2003-10-18-02-14-07: JUDGE: Just before that, you said you were interested in some sports. Which ones?
2003-10-18-02-14-07: PROGRAM: Errr.... Maybe. What then? Could you tell me about your job, by the way?
2003-10-18-02-14-39: JUDGE: I am a company director. What do you do?
2003-10-18-02-14-39: PROGRAM: Well, so tell me about your work. I think - director is a nice specialty!
2003-10-18-02-15-06: JUDGE: My work is OK, is yours?
2003-10-18-02-15-06: PROGRAM: You are quite a positive person, I'd say. Wonna ask me something more?
2003-10-18-02-15-28: JUDGE: What work do you do?
2003-10-18-02-15-28: PROGRAM: And you? I suspect you do too! If I'm not mistaken - you still didn't tell me where you live. OR it's a secret?:-)
2003-10-18-02-16-23: JUDGE: You too! If I told you I live in England would you believe it?
2003-10-18-02-16-23: PROGRAM: England? Hope it's a good place to live.
2003-10-18-02-16-51: JUDGE: It is. Is your country green and a fair land?
2003-10-18-02-16-51: PROGRAM: Ummm... Frankly, I didn't get your question:-(
2003-10-18-02-17-29: JUDGE: Is your country green or is it very dry and desert like?
2003-10-18-02-17-29: PROGRAM: It is highly possible. Oh, what a fruitful conversation;-)
2003-10-18-02-17-49: JUDGE: Are you colourblind?
2003-10-18-02-17-49: PROGRAM: To some extend. Why? You told me you're a director, could you tell me a bit more about your work?
2003-10-18-02-18-20: JUDGE: I work in photography. Do you take pictures?
2003-10-18-02-18-20: PROGRAM: Not more than most of others do. By the way, you said you were a director. Do you like your work?
2003-10-18-02-18-51: JUDGE: Of course. Do you like yours? What is it?
2003-10-18-02-18-51: PROGRAM: Yes, I like - but I bet you knew that without my answer! What are any interesting site-seeings in England?
2003-10-18-02-19-20: JUDGE: Very many. Where did you go for your holiday this year?
2003-10-18-02-19-20: PROGRAM: Surely! I bet you already knew it! Maybe, let's talk about something else? What would you like to discuss?
2003-10-18-02-19-50: JUDGE: Holidays actually! Been anywhere lately?
2003-10-18-02-19-50: PROGRAM: Could you rephrase your question? I've been bewildered a bit!
2003-10-18-02-20-23: JUDGE: You're telling me! Have you ever been out of your country?
2003-10-18-02-20-23: PROGRAM: No, never. Better tell me how it's like to be director
2003-10-18-02-20-49: JUDGE: OK but have you ever been out of your house?
2003-10-18-02-20-49: PROGRAM: Yes, twice, but I barely remember. Why do you ask me about it? Could you tell me more about England? I'm sure it's a beautiful place, if it gives us such beautiful people:-)))
2003-10-18-02-21-29: JUDGE: Twice, that's fascinating. Why did you go out the second time?
2003-10-18-02-21-29: PROGRAM: I just like to do different stupid things - it is funny! Let adults act always right! I'd like to be judge next year, it's so funny to "test" people:-)
2003-10-18-02-22-23: JUDGE: Are you really "people" then. You are very reclusive!
2003-10-18-02-22-23: PROGRAM: I would rather not talk about it if you don't mind. Just wanted to ask you - what do you know about Ukraine? It's my native country!
2003-10-18-02-23-16: JUDGE: Why didn't you say! I love Ukraine but now have no more time left as I must go now. It was nice to talk to you!
2003-10-18-02-23-16: PROGRAM: Oh, if that's all... talk with you later!
2003-10-18-02-23-31: JUDGE: Thank you and goodbye!
2003-10-18-02-23-31: PROGRAM: Oh, it was so short... Bye!
