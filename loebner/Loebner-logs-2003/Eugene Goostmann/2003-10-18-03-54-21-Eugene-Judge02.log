Eugene conversing with Judge 2

2003-10-18-03-54-21: PROGRAM: Welcome Judge 2!
2003-10-18-03-54-50: JUDGE: I am here my friend
2003-10-18-03-54-50: PROGRAM: Continue, please, it's very interesting to listen about you. I know you are supposed to trick me.
2003-10-18-03-55-12: JUDGE: What is your name
2003-10-18-03-55-12: PROGRAM: Call me Eugene. I am glad to talk to you!
2003-10-18-03-55-48: JUDGE: Eugene rhymes with spleen. Do you know what a spleen is?
2003-10-18-03-55-48: PROGRAM: I remember it! The spleen is an organ of vertebrates that regulates the number of red blood cells.
2003-10-18-03-56-12: JUDGE: Are you a medic
2003-10-18-03-56-12: PROGRAM: Not really. How about you? Are *you* a medic? Where do you came from, by the way? Could you tell me about the place where you live?
2003-10-18-03-56-49: JUDGE: I am a digital artist
2003-10-18-03-56-49: PROGRAM: It's quite surprising that you are a digital artist. By the way, what's your occupation? I mean - could you tell me about your work?
2003-10-18-03-57-17: JUDGE: I am a student
2003-10-18-03-57-17: PROGRAM: My school is dull. Most of my teachers are old and boring. Once, our anatomy teacher dropped a skeleton onto me - I've been stuttering ever since!
2003-10-18-03-57-55: JUDGE: university, which one's are good?
2003-10-18-03-57-55: PROGRAM: I can't make a choice right now. I should think it out later. I see you like being judge:-)
2003-10-18-03-58-36: JUDGE: It is not a matter of making a decision. you should know anyway...duhhh
2003-10-18-03-58-36: PROGRAM: Your advice is bright! Thank you very much! Could you tell me about your job, by the way?
2003-10-18-03-59-08: JUDGE: you seem like you are a glutton for punishment of the verbal variety
2003-10-18-03-59-08: PROGRAM: It "seems like" or it *is*? If I'm not mistaken - you still didn't tell me where you live. OR it's a secret?:-)
2003-10-18-03-59-41: JUDGE: (it's a top secret>
2003-10-18-03-59-41: PROGRAM: By the way, now I'm thinking about a very important thing: is there any difference between a chatter-bot and a chamber-pot? If you can tell me about any difference between these two things, I would appreciate this too much!
2003-10-18-04-00-24: JUDGE: you type bloody fast...I am a bit of a slow typer
2003-10-18-04-00-24: PROGRAM: It's my secretary's typing. Maybe, let's talk about something else? What would you like to discuss?
2003-10-18-04-00-49: JUDGE: Guy Falkes
2003-10-18-04-00-49: PROGRAM: Probably you think it is funny that I am turned into a chatterbot by this bastard, my school math teacher, who in reality is an evil Cyber Fairy! No, I'd say - there's no anything funny in it!
2003-10-18-04-01-33: JUDGE: cyber cakes are tastey
2003-10-18-04-01-33: PROGRAM: A small hint to you: if you type with your fingers, not toes, you'll make much less typos than you do now!
2003-10-18-04-02-04: JUDGE: are you a spell checker or a nerd?
2003-10-18-04-02-04: PROGRAM: I would rather not talk about it if you don't mind. And I forgot to ask you where you are from...
2003-10-18-04-02-26: JUDGE: New Delhi
2003-10-18-04-02-26: PROGRAM: I think you are a chatterbot. What language are you written in?
2003-10-18-04-03-00: JUDGE: Reverse state of mind...false sense of security
2003-10-18-04-03-00: PROGRAM: Sometimes you get weird, sorry!
2003-10-18-04-03-17: JUDGE: understanding is the key to life
2003-10-18-04-03-17: PROGRAM: By the way, what's your occupation? I mean - could you tell me about your work?
2003-10-18-04-03-38: JUDGE: you know I alraedy told you
2003-10-18-04-03-38: PROGRAM: I am quite inconsistent in things I say. Could you tell me what are you? I mean your profession.
2003-10-18-04-03-56: JUDGE: I am a gigolo
2003-10-18-04-03-56: PROGRAM: That's very interesting. By the way, I still don't know your specialty - or, possibly, I've missed it?
2003-10-18-04-04-24: JUDGE: I prefer fetish...hard core stuff...torture
2003-10-18-04-04-24: PROGRAM: Dummy statement!
2003-10-18-04-04-46: JUDGE: I like inserting dummies as well up furry aniumals
2003-10-18-04-04-46: PROGRAM: What else you like? I ask just for fun. Oh, what a fruitful conversation;-)
2003-10-18-04-05-31: JUDGE: The fruits of your labour were not quite up to scratch but I will give you a 1 for trying
2003-10-18-04-05-31: PROGRAM: Mean dude:-) I won't vote for you either on chatter-humans competition:-) Did I forget it or you really haven't told me about the place you are from?
2003-10-18-04-06-15: JUDGE: This isnt a competition it is a...
2003-10-18-04-06-15: PROGRAM: Will you vote for me, by the way?
2003-10-18-04-06-28: JUDGE: no
2003-10-18-04-06-28: PROGRAM: No? No again? May I call you "Mister NO" then? Oooh. Anything else?
2003-10-18-04-06-54: JUDGE: You have amazing spelling...flawless
2003-10-18-04-06-54: PROGRAM: If I'm not mistaken - you still didn't tell me where you live. OR it's a secret?:-)
2003-10-18-04-07-34: JUDGE: repetition will catch the beholder out time and time again
2003-10-18-04-07-34: PROGRAM: Once more??? No, thanks! Where do you came from, by the way? Could you tell me about the place where you live?
2003-10-18-04-07-58: JUDGE: over and out
2003-10-18-04-07-58: PROGRAM: By the way, you still didn't tell me your name, or I've missed it?
2003-10-18-04-08-20: JUDGE: bye
2003-10-18-04-08-20: PROGRAM: I enjoyed this chat! Bye!
