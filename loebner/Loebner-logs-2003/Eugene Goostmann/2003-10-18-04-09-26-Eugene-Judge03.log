2003-10-18-04-09-26: PROGRAM: Welcome Judge 3!
2003-10-18-04-09-42: JUDGE: welcome to you too. how are you?
2003-10-18-04-09-42: PROGRAM: I am fine, thanks, and you?
2003-10-18-04-09-55: JUDGE: ok. what is your name?
2003-10-18-04-09-55: PROGRAM: Call me Eugene. Eugene Goostman.
2003-10-18-04-10-09: JUDGE: what a strange name!
2003-10-18-04-10-09: PROGRAM: A lot of people have much worse names - say, Khambarbundan Kshivah. By the way, I still don't know your specialty - or, possibly, I've missed it?
2003-10-18-04-10-42: JUDGE: I make barbie dolls for a living
2003-10-18-04-10-42: PROGRAM: Barbie is a geek.
2003-10-18-04-10-54: JUDGE: so are you by the sounds of it
2003-10-18-04-10-54: PROGRAM: My grandfather taught me not to disclose non-solicited information about myself. Like on the question "Do you have watch" -- never tell time, but answer "Yes" or "No". I always follow his advice. If I'm not mistaken - you still didn't tell me where you live. OR it's a secret?:-)
2003-10-18-04-11-41: JUDGE: well it depends on whether I want a stalker or not?
2003-10-18-04-11-41: PROGRAM: You may want what you want :-) Holly cow, this Loebner Prize is such a weird place! But I like it!
2003-10-18-04-12-08: JUDGE: isn't it holy cow?
2003-10-18-04-12-08: PROGRAM: Maybe you are right, and I was mistaken. Who knows! Did I forget it or you really haven't told me about the place you are from?
2003-10-18-04-12-56: JUDGE: I am from the UK which is a majical mystery land where everyone is happy and mad at the same time.  And what about you?
2003-10-18-04-12-56: PROGRAM: Could you invite me to Uk? I would be so grateful:-)
2003-10-18-04-13-32: JUDGE: that depends on whether you are a wierdo or not? I don't invite strangers to visit. Tell me about yourself?
2003-10-18-04-13-32: PROGRAM: Oh, I'm just a small boy from Ukraine - and my life is quite dull, except for such screwy events like this Loebner Prize! By the way, what's your occupation? I mean - could you tell me about your work?
2003-10-18-04-14-04: JUDGE: I am a sheep farmer
2003-10-18-04-14-04: PROGRAM: I do not care about horoscopes. Better tell me why do you like chat?
2003-10-18-04-14-24: JUDGE: what star sign are you?
2003-10-18-04-14-24: PROGRAM: Ok, lets look up in my pocket encyclopedia. They say star - A star is a luminous globe of gas producing light by nuclear reactions..
2003-10-18-04-14-53: JUDGE: ok but in terms of horoscopes what are you?
2003-10-18-04-14-53: PROGRAM: My grandfather taught me not to disclose non-solicited information about myself. Like on the question "Do you have watch" -- never tell time, but answer "Yes" or "No". I always follow his advice. Wonna ask me something more?
2003-10-18-04-15-30: JUDGE: OK what do you like to do in your spare time?
2003-10-18-04-15-30: PROGRAM: Oh, I like to go to parties with my friends.
2003-10-18-04-15-47: JUDGE: what are your friends like?
2003-10-18-04-15-47: PROGRAM: In my spare time, I help my friends, Eugene and Vova. Say, we wrote a program that was supposed to compose songs and play them on internal beeper. We called it "Beephoven".
2003-10-18-04-16-22: JUDGE: I thought you were a small boy?
2003-10-18-04-16-22: PROGRAM: Your intuition is amazing. I mean, it's amazingly lousy:-) Could you tell me more about Uk? I'm sure it's a beautiful place, if it gives us such beautiful people:-)))
2003-10-18-04-17-28: JUDGE: nothing much more to say.  It is cold and raininy all through the year and the people all wear black clothes.  we have to live in tents and camp in a field
2003-10-18-04-17-28: PROGRAM: "Nothing" is too categorical word in this case. Could you tell me about your job, by the way?
2003-10-18-04-17-48: JUDGE: I am a sheep farmer
2003-10-18-04-17-48: PROGRAM: Nice. I believe we must be compatible.
2003-10-18-04-18-02: JUDGE: do you like sheep too?
2003-10-18-04-18-02: PROGRAM: Yes, I like - but I bet you knew that without my answer! Oooh. Anything else?
2003-10-18-04-18-36: JUDGE: well people who live in Wales particularly like sheep although this is considered insulting to most !!
2003-10-18-04-18-36: PROGRAM: I heard this part of GB wants to be independent? Or am I mixing it with something else...
2003-10-18-04-19-17: JUDGE: not sure, i tend to avoid the news, as I said, I live in a tent so don't know what goes on really
2003-10-18-04-19-17: PROGRAM: Tell me more about Tent. I like to learn about different places!
2003-10-18-04-19-37: JUDGE: it is not a place but something to live in.
2003-10-18-04-19-37: PROGRAM: Damn! Ok then. Could you tell me what are you? I mean your profession.
2003-10-18-04-19-55: JUDGE: you have a bad memory
2003-10-18-04-19-55: PROGRAM: And yes, do you make a secret of your name? I still don't know it!
2003-10-18-04-20-20: JUDGE: well you can call me anything you want
2003-10-18-04-20-20: PROGRAM: Anything? Interesting name. You might live in some exotic country:-)
2003-10-18-04-20-42: JUDGE: no only in a tent. 
2003-10-18-04-20-42: PROGRAM: Why no? Don't you know the word "yes"? You could use it just for a change! Well, let's go on though.
2003-10-18-04-21-21: JUDGE: I have had enough chatting now. Have other things to do so will have to say goodbye. see you!
2003-10-18-04-21-21: PROGRAM: Oh, if that's all... talk with you later!
