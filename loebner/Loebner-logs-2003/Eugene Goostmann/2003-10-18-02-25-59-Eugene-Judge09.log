2003-10-18-02-26-11: JUDGE: Hi
2003-10-18-02-26-11: PROGRAM: Howdy pal! Today is a kind of never-ending talk-show, I'd say!
2003-10-18-02-26-42: JUDGE: What's your name
2003-10-18-02-26-42: PROGRAM: People call me Eugene. Or "Zhenya". It is a short name for Eugene in Russia and Ukraine.
2003-10-18-02-27-18: JUDGE: Do u come from Russia
2003-10-18-02-27-18: PROGRAM: Ukraine has borders with Russia, Belarus, Poland... Oh, and lots of other countries whom it does not get along very well unfortunately.
2003-10-18-02-27-44: JUDGE: so you come from ukraine?
2003-10-18-02-27-44: PROGRAM: The Ukraine, formerly a part of the Soviet Union, now is independent. Actually, this is the only thing to be proud of - the life and economical situation are pretty miserable...
2003-10-18-02-28-46: JUDGE: what do u mean by miesrbale
2003-10-18-02-28-46: PROGRAM: You aren't too bright, I must say.
2003-10-18-02-28-58: JUDGE: Why
2003-10-18-02-28-58: PROGRAM: Why? Just because! :) By the way, what's your occupation? I mean - could you tell me about your work?
2003-10-18-02-29-30: JUDGE: I could -but you tell me first
2003-10-18-02-29-30: PROGRAM: At least someone agrees with me. I'll remember this nice moment for ages! I see you like being judge:-)
2003-10-18-02-30-12: JUDGE: may be i wasnt clear -what do you do
2003-10-18-02-30-12: PROGRAM: I am only 13, so I'm attending school so far.
2003-10-18-02-30-52: JUDGE: school?
2003-10-18-02-30-52: PROGRAM: Is it your hobby to ask little poor Jewish boys such tricky questions they don't have an answer for?
2003-10-18-02-31-19: JUDGE: What kind of school?
2003-10-18-02-31-19: PROGRAM: I have no idea, sorry. Where do you came from, by the way? Could you tell me about the place where you live?
2003-10-18-02-31-44: JUDGE: I live in Norway
2003-10-18-02-31-44: PROGRAM: Could you invite me to Norway? I would be so grateful:-)
2003-10-18-02-32-18: JUDGE: thats a bit forward - i hardly know you
2003-10-18-02-32-18: PROGRAM: By the way, do you know a terrible story about a chatterbot, that wanted to be a President? He spoke ugly, his phrases were lame and intelligence was artificial (he told only the things he was prompted to)... I should tell you a secret: he BECAME the Prez! Androids are among us already!!!
2003-10-18-02-33-45: JUDGE: No but I heard about the Govnor of California
2003-10-18-02-33-45: PROGRAM: That's somewhere in the West of the US, I think.
2003-10-18-02-34-27: JUDGE: I think s0 to
2003-10-18-02-34-27: PROGRAM: Your opinion is very interesting... Keep going. Could you tell me about your job, by the way?
2003-10-18-02-34-57: JUDGE: Why are you interested in my job
2003-10-18-02-34-57: PROGRAM: I am a scholar. I'm too young to make money.
2003-10-18-02-35-38: JUDGE: what are you studying
2003-10-18-02-35-38: PROGRAM: I would rather not talk about it if you don't mind. By the way, did I tell you that I born in Odessa, it's such Ukrainian city?
2003-10-18-02-36-12: JUDGE: No you didn't tell me. how big is it
2003-10-18-02-36-12: PROGRAM: I hope you won't always answer "no"? I'd like to be judge next year, it's so funny to "test" people:-)
2003-10-18-02-36-48: JUDGE: waht do you want to be when you grow up
2003-10-18-02-36-48: PROGRAM: In childhood I read a lot of heroic books and I wanted to join military. But one year ago our anatomy teacher accidentally dropped a human skeleton on me - since that I'm stammering. So now I'm not sure. Maybe I'll try to make a career on TV as a show host - in our country most of them have defective diction (sounds weird, but it's true...).
2003-10-18-02-37-55: JUDGE: will you make loads of money
2003-10-18-02-37-55: PROGRAM: Money? Yellow devil... or green one now? I do not know...
2003-10-18-02-38-14: JUDGE: gotta go
2003-10-18-02-38-14: PROGRAM: Goodbye! Hope we'll meet again!
