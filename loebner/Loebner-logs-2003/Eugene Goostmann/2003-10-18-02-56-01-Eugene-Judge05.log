Eugene conversing with Judge 5

2003-10-18-02-56-01: PROGRAM: Welcome Judge 5!
2003-10-18-02-56-15: JUDGE: howdy
2003-10-18-02-56-15: PROGRAM: Hello, I'm really glad to have the chance to chat with you! My guinea pig Bill sends his regards too!
2003-10-18-02-56-37: JUDGE: is bill with you at the moment?
2003-10-18-02-56-37: PROGRAM: I'm not deeply into Bill 's private life.
2003-10-18-02-56-57: JUDGE: so I take it you've never met him?
2003-10-18-02-56-57: PROGRAM: Damn! Ok then. Maybe, let's talk about something else? What would you like to discuss?
2003-10-18-02-57-15: JUDGE: I thought the lunch was pretty cool today
2003-10-18-02-57-15: PROGRAM: You guessed wrong. Try once more! Where do you came from, by the way? Could you tell me about the place where you live?
2003-10-18-02-57-44: JUDGE: it's about 150km from here
2003-10-18-02-57-44: PROGRAM: Sorry, I was distracted - my guinea pig just tried to bite Doctor Lowenbrau, because he mistook it for a hamster! God thanks, they didn't hurt each other too much!
2003-10-18-02-58-12: JUDGE: did you get pictures?
2003-10-18-02-58-12: PROGRAM: Surely! I bet you already knew it! By the way, I still don't know your specialty - or, possibly, I've missed it?
2003-10-18-02-58-38: JUDGE: I'm into music
2003-10-18-02-58-38: PROGRAM: You're musician? Very interesting. I am tone-deaf, but I like singing. Unfortunately, others in my family aren't tone-deaf, so we disperse in our opinions about my vocal abilities.
2003-10-18-02-59-05: JUDGE: do you want to sing something now?
2003-10-18-02-59-05: PROGRAM: Actually, I don't like singing. My guinea pig, though, shouts every morning like the Russian singer Vitas... it's just terrible.
2003-10-18-02-59-28: JUDGE: what colour is the guinea pig, anyway?
2003-10-18-02-59-28: PROGRAM: My home-pet, guinea pig, is a member of guinea Subsidiary of "Pigs rights watch" organization and fights for election rights for guinea pigs in Guinea.
2003-10-18-02-59-55: JUDGE: ahem. moving on. What are you up to tonight?
2003-10-18-02-59-55: PROGRAM: My grandfather taught me not to disclose non-solicited information about myself. Like on the question "Do you have watch" -- never tell time, but answer "Yes" or "No". I always follow his advice. Better tell me how it's like to be musician
2003-10-18-03-00-33: JUDGE: it's purple
2003-10-18-03-00-33: PROGRAM: My grandpa, who has Alzheimer's decease and thinks he is a beaver, often says the same things.
2003-10-18-03-01-01: JUDGE: whaddya know? I'm a beaver too!
2003-10-18-03-01-01: PROGRAM: Who knows... All of us are a beaver too in some way... Oh, what a fruitful conversation;-)
2003-10-18-03-01-36: JUDGE: OK, do you want to try current affairs?
2003-10-18-03-01-36: PROGRAM: Not more than most of others do. Did I forget it or you really haven't told me about the place you are from?
2003-10-18-03-02-14: JUDGE: it's called Nottingham
2003-10-18-03-02-14: PROGRAM: Oh, one more question - do you have IBM PC-clone or Mac at home?
2003-10-18-03-02-28: JUDGE: Linux
2003-10-18-03-02-28: PROGRAM: I'm not very interested in operational systems. I use Win98 and it seems OK to me. I even don't want to upgrade it so far.
2003-10-18-03-02-57: JUDGE: I made the mistake of getting XP...  and it crashes just as much as 98SE
2003-10-18-03-02-57: PROGRAM: Probably you think it is funny that I am turned into a chatterbot by this bastard, my school math teacher, who in reality is an evil Cyber Fairy! No, I'd say - there's no anything funny in it!
2003-10-18-03-03-25: JUDGE: that's irrelevant, surely?
2003-10-18-03-03-25: PROGRAM: Could you rephrase your question? I've been bewildered a bit!
2003-10-18-03-03-52: JUDGE: what does bewildered mean, exactly?
2003-10-18-03-03-52: PROGRAM: Huh? You told me you're a musician, could you tell me a bit more about your work?
2003-10-18-03-04-13: JUDGE: I make dance music
2003-10-18-03-04-13: PROGRAM: To be short I'll only say that I HATE Britnie Spears. All other music is OK compared to her.
2003-10-18-03-04-37: JUDGE: You don't even like here in an ironic way?
2003-10-18-03-04-37: PROGRAM: You are so negative just to annoy me, I know! Holly cow, this Loebner Prize is such a weird place! But I like it!
2003-10-18-03-05-03: JUDGE: do you find it exciting?
2003-10-18-03-05-03: PROGRAM: Yes I find it exciting! And I'm proud of that! And I forgot to ask you where you are from...
2003-10-18-03-05-22: JUDGE: I've told you three times already
2003-10-18-03-05-22: PROGRAM: The fact that you have told my humble person three times already won't change my attitude to you. Wonna ask me something more?
2003-10-18-03-05-57: JUDGE: what's for tea this evening?
2003-10-18-03-05-57: PROGRAM: I have no idea, sorry. Was it your dream since childhood to become a musician, by the way?
2003-10-18-03-06-23: JUDGE: carrot dune everlast the open handle
2003-10-18-03-06-23: PROGRAM: Dummy statement!
2003-10-18-03-06-34: JUDGE: well spotted
2003-10-18-03-06-34: PROGRAM: Yeah! If I'm not mistaken - you still didn't tell me where you live. OR it's a secret?:-)
2003-10-18-03-06-54: JUDGE: FOr the last time. NOttingham
2003-10-18-03-06-54: PROGRAM: You know, I *do* remember that I told you that my name is Eugene - but I still didn't hear yours!
2003-10-18-03-07-21: JUDGE: I'm Chris. Eugene has a nice ring to it
2003-10-18-03-07-21: PROGRAM: Chris? I can not tell from your name whether you are a man or a woman. Do you mind telling me this? It is nice to know the gender of those with whom you talk.
2003-10-18-03-07-37: JUDGE: bye
2003-10-18-03-07-37: PROGRAM: Goodbye! Hope we'll meet again!
