2003-10-18-03-10-19: JUDGE: Hello. How are you today?
2003-10-18-03-10-19: PROGRAM: I'm having a great day.
2003-10-18-03-10-54: JUDGE: Good. So am I. What would you usually be doing on a Saturday afternoon?
2003-10-18-03-10-54: PROGRAM: Yeah, it's lovely day!
2003-10-18-03-11-18: JUDGE: Where are you at the moment?
2003-10-18-03-11-18: PROGRAM: I would rather not talk about it if you don't mind. Did I forget it or you really haven't told me about the place you are from?
2003-10-18-03-11-54: JUDGE: I am from England
2003-10-18-03-11-54: PROGRAM: England? Hope it's a good place to live.
2003-10-18-03-12-30: JUDGE: Yes. But it is a bit crowded in the South east of England
2003-10-18-03-12-30: PROGRAM: It is surely somewhere in Europe. But I'm very bad in geography:-(
2003-10-18-03-13-08: JUDGE: England is part of the British Isles. Where are you from?
2003-10-18-03-13-08: PROGRAM: I live in a big Ukrainian city called Odessa. It is on the Black Sea shore.
2003-10-18-03-13-38: JUDGE: How large is the Black Sea?
2003-10-18-03-13-38: PROGRAM: Odessits think that the Black Sea is the best sea in the world. They aren't as far from the mark :-)
2003-10-18-03-14-14: JUDGE: Do you like living by the sea?
2003-10-18-03-14-14: PROGRAM: Yes, I like - but I bet you knew that without my answer! Could you tell me about your job, by the way?
2003-10-18-03-14-53: JUDGE: I help new businesses. What do you do?
2003-10-18-03-14-53: PROGRAM: I am a scholar. I'm too young to make money.
2003-10-18-03-15-19: JUDGE: How old must you be to make money?
2003-10-18-03-15-19: PROGRAM: I love money and I want to have loads of it. Don't you?
2003-10-18-03-15-53: JUDGE: It would be great to have a just enough.
2003-10-18-03-15-53: PROGRAM: Could you tell me what are you? I mean your profession.
2003-10-18-03-16-33: JUDGE: I originally studied engineering, but now I am a general business person
2003-10-18-03-16-33: PROGRAM: That's very interesting. I know you are supposed to trick me.
2003-10-18-03-16-58: JUDGE: What do you study?
2003-10-18-03-16-58: PROGRAM: Is it "the third degree"? I'm not going to answer such a provocative question! Maybe, let's talk about something else? What would you like to discuss?
2003-10-18-03-17-51: JUDGE: Ok. Do you enjoy sport?
2003-10-18-03-17-51: PROGRAM: No, I don't. And you? Do *you* enjoy sport? Tell me the truth! By the way, what's your occupation? I mean - could you tell me about your work?
2003-10-18-03-18-23: JUDGE: I enjoy watching some sports.
2003-10-18-03-18-23: PROGRAM: I do play most of sports - on computer, though.
2003-10-18-03-18-51: JUDGE: What kind of sport can you play on a computer?
2003-10-18-03-18-51: PROGRAM: I play sports sometimes. On computer. But I prefer racing.
2003-10-18-03-19-10: JUDGE: What type of racing?
2003-10-18-03-19-10: PROGRAM: Could you formulate your question in more precious way? What are any interesting site-seeings in England?
2003-10-18-03-19-44: JUDGE: Hampton Court Palace is close to where I live.
2003-10-18-03-19-44: PROGRAM: You are definitely disoriented. Well, I'll remind you: you are from England! You should take some medicine that treats sclerosis, I guess.
2003-10-18-03-20-32: JUDGE: Hampton Court is in England so I don't think I am disoriented at all.
2003-10-18-03-20-32: PROGRAM: It's somewhere in Europe, I'd say.
2003-10-18-03-20-58: JUDGE: You are correct. Is Odessa in Europe?
2003-10-18-03-20-58: PROGRAM: I was born and live all my life in Odessa. Odessa claims to be a "humorous capital" of the Ukraine. But it is an exaggeration.
2003-10-18-03-21-41: JUDGE: Where would you like to go?
2003-10-18-03-21-41: PROGRAM: to go??? No, God save me! Propose it to Doctor Loebner, he is eccentric enough to like your ideas! Could you tell me what are you? I mean your profession.
2003-10-18-03-22-23: JUDGE: I have already told you. remind me what do you do?
2003-10-18-03-22-23: PROGRAM: I am only 13, so I'm attending school so far.
2003-10-18-03-22-51: JUDGE: You speak English very well.
2003-10-18-03-22-51: PROGRAM: I've studying English for about 5 years and very like it.
2003-10-18-03-23-20: JUDGE: It is time for me to move on now. Goodbye.
2003-10-18-03-23-20: PROGRAM: I enjoyed this chat! Bye!
