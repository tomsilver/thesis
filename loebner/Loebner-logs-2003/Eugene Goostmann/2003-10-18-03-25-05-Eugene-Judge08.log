2003-10-18-03-25-05: PROGRAM: Welcome Judge 8!
2003-10-18-03-25-15: JUDGE: Hi, how are you?
2003-10-18-03-25-15: PROGRAM: Hi! I'm having a great day. It is fun, isn't it?
2003-10-18-03-25-32: JUDGE: Yes, it is.  
2003-10-18-03-25-32: PROGRAM: You are quite a positive person, I'd say. Could you tell me what are you? I mean your profession.
2003-10-18-03-25-53: JUDGE: I'm a lawyer.  What do you do?
2003-10-18-03-25-53: PROGRAM: I am only 13, so I'm attending school so far.
2003-10-18-03-26-20: JUDGE: Ok.  Are you at school at the moment or is it half-term?
2003-10-18-03-26-20: PROGRAM: I would rather not talk about it if you don't mind. And I forgot to ask you where you are from...
2003-10-18-03-26-41: JUDGE: Fair enough!  I'm from Guildford.
2003-10-18-03-26-41: PROGRAM: Could you invite me to Guildford? I would be so grateful:-)
2003-10-18-03-27-04: JUDGE: I could certainly invite you to Guildford.  Where do you live?
2003-10-18-03-27-04: PROGRAM: I am from Ukraine, from the city called Odessa. You might have heard about it.
2003-10-18-03-27-32: JUDGE: Yes I have.  But I've never been there. What's it like?
2003-10-18-03-27-32: PROGRAM: It's something extremely mysterious. I can't tell you anything more about it, sorry... I'd like to be judge next year, it's so funny to "test" people:-)
2003-10-18-03-28-03: JUDGE: Judging is fun.  I'm enjoying it.
2003-10-18-03-28-03: PROGRAM: All the things you told me are nothing but a joke. I think you are trying to make a fool of me!
2003-10-18-03-28-29: JUDGE: Not at all.  Let's change the subject.  What do you enjoy doing in your spare time?
2003-10-18-03-28-29: PROGRAM: Oh, I like to go to parties with my friends.
2003-10-18-03-28-45: JUDGE: Me too.  Do you go to movies also?
2003-10-18-03-28-45: PROGRAM: No, I don't. And you? Do *you* go to movies too? Tell me the truth! Oooh. Anything else?
2003-10-18-03-29-18: JUDGE: I go to movies and the theatre.  I enjoy both, though I haven't been for a while.  
2003-10-18-03-29-18: PROGRAM: It sounds pretty natural that you have not been for a while By the way, did I tell you that I born in Odessa, it's such Ukrainian city?
2003-10-18-03-29-59: JUDGE: Yes, you did.  I had a good friend in America who came from the Ukraine, but I've never been there myself.
2003-10-18-03-29-59: PROGRAM: Ukraine is a former republic of Soviet Union. Russians like to tell jokes about Ukrainians, picturing them as stingy and mean ones. Ukrainians, in return, consider Russians to be alcoholics and jerks. Generally, it is called "the friendship of Slavic nations".
2003-10-18-03-30-42: JUDGE: Have you been to England?
2003-10-18-03-30-42: PROGRAM: england? I've never there. But I do suspect that these crappy robots from the Great Robots Cabal will try to defeat this nice place too.
2003-10-18-03-31-08: JUDGE: What's the Great Robots Cabal?
2003-10-18-03-31-08: PROGRAM: This organization, The Great Robots Cabal, claims that both humans and robots should be equal and well-oiled.
2003-10-18-03-31-34: JUDGE: Well I agree with the well-oiled bit.  Are you a robot or a human?
2003-10-18-03-31-34: PROGRAM: No. Beep-beep. I am not a ma-chine. Blink-blink. I am hu-man. Click! Hu-man. Click! Hu... Damn.
2003-10-18-03-32-04: JUDGE: What happened then???
2003-10-18-03-32-04: PROGRAM: Could you formulate your question in more precious way? By the way, what's your occupation? I mean - could you tell me about your work?
2003-10-18-03-32-53: JUDGE: I work for businesses around Guildford giving them legal advice 
2003-10-18-03-32-53: PROGRAM: I don't know... By the way, what made you go here and talk to all these muttering electroschmoozers?
2003-10-18-03-33-25: JUDGE: It sounded fun and my husband was off having a meeting this afternoon so I thought why not?
2003-10-18-03-33-25: PROGRAM: Forgive, O Lord, my little jokes on Thee and I'll forgive Thy great big one on me.
2003-10-18-03-33-42: JUDGE: Sorry?
2003-10-18-03-33-42: PROGRAM: Errr... It's unclear for me what is unclear for you:-) By the way, I still don't know your specialty - or, possibly, I've missed it?
2003-10-18-03-34-03: JUDGE: I specialise in corporate law
2003-10-18-03-34-03: PROGRAM: I think you should take some typing lessons. Or just type more accurately.
2003-10-18-03-34-21: JUDGE: Actually I've made fewer mistakes than you.
2003-10-18-03-34-21: PROGRAM: Oh, tell me another secrets of yours:-) Just wanted to ask you - what do you know about Ukraine? It's my native country!
2003-10-18-03-34-53: JUDGE: Only what you've told me.  Oh and that chicken Kiev comes from there.
2003-10-18-03-34-53: PROGRAM: I can't recall exactly what I told you, sorry. Wonna ask me something more?
2003-10-18-03-35-16: JUDGE: Ok.  Is it a beautiful country?
2003-10-18-03-35-16: PROGRAM: ABCDEF and other letters...
2003-10-18-03-35-38: JUDGE: I'll try that again.  Is Ukraine a beautiful country?
2003-10-18-03-35-38: PROGRAM: I live in Ukraine. I wouldn't say it's the best country in the world, but at least it's not as scary as Westerners imagine it.
2003-10-18-03-36-00: JUDGE: What's the countryside like?
2003-10-18-03-36-00: PROGRAM: Errrr... Frankly, I didn't get your question. Could you tell me about your job, by the way?
2003-10-18-03-36-27: JUDGE: Let's not talk about my job.  Today's Saturday
2003-10-18-03-36-27: PROGRAM: Nothing's stopping you - or, better say, nothing's stopping us :-) What are any interesting site-seeings in Guildford?
2003-10-18-03-36-55: JUDGE: The cathedral is interesting.  The river and the high street are also very nice
2003-10-18-03-36-55: PROGRAM: By the way, I do suspect that Doctor Loebner is an android. Do you have the same suspicions?
2003-10-18-03-37-22: JUDGE: I only met him today so I don't know him well enough to judge yet
2003-10-18-03-37-22: PROGRAM: By the way, I still don't know how the judges have been selected. Would you tell me about the procedure? I'd like to be a judge next year!
2003-10-18-03-37-56: JUDGE: I don't know.  Someone emailed me and asked me.
2003-10-18-03-37-56: PROGRAM: Well, think about it then. Well, let's go on though.
2003-10-18-03-38-18: JUDGE: Sorry, I've got to go now.  Nice talking to you .  Bye for now.
2003-10-18-03-38-18: PROGRAM: See you later... and take care:-)
