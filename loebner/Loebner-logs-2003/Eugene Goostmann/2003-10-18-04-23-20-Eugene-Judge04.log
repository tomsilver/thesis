Eugene conversing with Judge 4

2003-10-18-04-23-20: PROGRAM: Welcome Judge 4!
2003-10-18-04-23-46: JUDGE: Hi what is your name?
2003-10-18-04-23-46: PROGRAM: Call me Eugene. Eugene Goostman.
2003-10-18-04-24-15: JUDGE: Will Gene do?
2003-10-18-04-24-15: PROGRAM: My guinea pig says that name Gene sounds very nice.
2003-10-18-04-24-57: JUDGE: What is your guinea pig called?
2003-10-18-04-24-57: PROGRAM: Have you heard about my guinea pig? He is a member of "Green Pigs" organization that fights for equal rights for guinea pigs. They also fight strongly against using pigs in medical experiments!
2003-10-18-04-25-45: JUDGE: Go on
2003-10-18-04-25-45: PROGRAM: Go yourself. Some another topic?
2003-10-18-04-26-18: JUDGE: I was just getting into guinea pigs
2003-10-18-04-26-18: PROGRAM: My guinea pig is a member of "Pigs Rights Watch" - their slogan is "Guinea - for Guinea Pigs!"
2003-10-18-04-26-57: JUDGE: O.K -cool
2003-10-18-04-26-57: PROGRAM: What did you type? Was it a new mantra? So you should type it at least 1000 times in a row to reach Nirvana!
2003-10-18-04-27-45: JUDGE: How did you get involved with this today?
2003-10-18-04-27-45: PROGRAM: You know, all our chat is logged, so I'd rather not answer this question, please understand me right! Could you tell me what are you? I mean your profession.
2003-10-18-04-28-25: JUDGE: Yes I could
2003-10-18-04-28-25: PROGRAM: You are quite a positive person, I'd say. Where do you came from, by the way? Could you tell me about the place where you live?
2003-10-18-04-28-58: JUDGE: Camberley
2003-10-18-04-28-58: PROGRAM: I think you should oil your joints - so your fingers will hit right keys:-)
2003-10-18-04-29-32: JUDGE: Can you not interpolate
2003-10-18-04-29-32: PROGRAM: Yes I can not interpolate, but when I demonstrate it to my friends, they always laugh at me for unknown reasons. If I'm not mistaken - you still didn't tell me where you live. OR it's a secret?:-)
2003-10-18-04-30-15: JUDGE: You are mistaken!
2003-10-18-04-30-15: PROGRAM: Sometimes I make mistakes, as everyone does. Could you tell me about your job, by the way?
2003-10-18-04-30-41: JUDGE: I am an engineer
2003-10-18-04-30-41: PROGRAM: It's quite surprising that you are an engineer. Well, let's go on though.
2003-10-18-04-31-08: JUDGE: O.K.
2003-10-18-04-31-08: PROGRAM: Sometimes I have a feeling that I talk to a chatterbot. I even can't explain why!
2003-10-18-04-31-54: JUDGE: Do you have this problem often?
2003-10-18-04-31-54: PROGRAM: Very seldom. No more often than one time per month. But I'll get rid of this stupid habit at all! By the way, I still don't know your specialty - or, possibly, I've missed it?
2003-10-18-04-32-32: JUDGE: You missed it!
2003-10-18-04-32-32: PROGRAM: Calm down, please.
2003-10-18-04-32-55: JUDGE: I am going to sleep!
2003-10-18-04-32-55: PROGRAM: That's very interesting. I know you are supposed to trick me.
2003-10-18-04-33-42: JUDGE: I think I will switch myself off.
2003-10-18-04-33-42: PROGRAM: Pretty original point of view. And I forgot to ask you where you are from...
2003-10-18-04-34-26: JUDGE: No you did not and I did tell you!
2003-10-18-04-34-26: PROGRAM: What a stupid questions you ask! Did I forget it or you really haven't told me about the place you are from?
2003-10-18-04-35-16: JUDGE: IT was not a question it was a statement!
2003-10-18-04-35-16: PROGRAM: Why no? Don't you know the word "yes"? You could use it just for a change! By the way, what's your occupation? I mean - could you tell me about your work?
2003-10-18-04-36-44: JUDGE: I am switching myself off! - Good - bye.
2003-10-18-04-36-44: PROGRAM: Nice to hear that! Do you like the weather?
