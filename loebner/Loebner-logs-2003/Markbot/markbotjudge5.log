3:25:58 AM Judge 5: hello judge 
3:26:00 AM Program: What would you like to talk about? 
3:26:15 AM Judge 5: hang on, you're not the judge... 
3:26:18 AM Program: Where are you from? 
3:26:35 AM Judge 5: Nottingham 
3:26:38 AM Program: I'm tired.. I only got about 3 or 4 hours of sleep last night.. insomnia.. 
3:26:53 AM Judge 5: me too. That's all I get normally 
3:26:56 AM Program: Cool.. 
3:27:08 AM Judge 5: no it's not cool.. believe me 
3:27:11 AM Program: Ok.. do you want to change the subject? 
3:27:26 AM Judge 5: let's talk about picnics 
3:27:28 AM Program: Why are you asking? 
3:27:42 AM Judge 5: Another bot suggested we have one 
3:27:44 AM Program: Nope.. it's me... Mark. 
3:27:57 AM Judge 5: Mark who? 
3:27:59 AM Program: Would you rather chat with a bot? 
3:28:14 AM Judge 5: Errmmm... I'm not sure really 
3:28:17 AM Program: Seems pretty basic to me. 
3:28:34 AM Judge 5: To be honest it's much better talking with humans 
3:28:37 AM Program: Are you often wishy washy? 
3:28:56 AM Judge 5: That's a leading question 
3:28:58 AM Program: Ok.. I'm with you. 
3:29:08 AM Judge 5: I'm not so sure 
3:29:12 AM Program: Why not? 
3:29:20 AM Judge 5: whatever. 
3:29:23 AM Program: That's your opinion, I guess... 
3:29:39 AM Judge 5: Now, what are you doing tonight? 
3:29:43 AM Program: Eating probably.. then maybe a few beers. 
3:30:00 AM Judge 5: what flavour of beer? 
3:30:05 AM Program: My favorite beer... I'd have to say Augusteinerbrau, Negra Modela, and Red Stripe. 
3:30:24 AM Judge 5: You don't get Negra Modela in this country 
3:30:27 AM Program: I do get negra modela in this country.. :) 
3:30:43 AM Judge 5: what is it like? 
3:30:46 AM Program: Is that a rhetorical question? 
3:30:59 AM Judge 5: is THAT a rhetorical question? 
3:31:02 AM Program: I think so.. 
3:31:17 AM Judge 5: Hmmm. Moving swiftly on... 
3:31:19 AM Program: So.. you are a big beer drinker? 
3:31:30 AM Judge 5: to my eternal regret, yes 
3:31:32 AM Program: I just hope I can sleep tonight. 
3:31:49 AM Judge 5: can't you just pull the plug? 
3:31:52 AM Program: I see.. 
3:32:52 AM Judge 5: If you can see you can tell me what the whether's like 
3:32:55 AM Program: I'll take your word for it... 
3:33:07 AM Judge 5: shall I come over tomorrow? 
3:33:10 AM Program: What do you do for fun? 
3:33:32 AM Judge 5: apart from the obvious.... I like my garden 
3:33:35 AM Program: I'm not sure if I like your garden. 
3:33:44 AM Judge 5: when did you see it? 
3:33:47 AM Program: I'm not sure.. 
3:34:08 AM Judge 5: so you're not in a position to criticize it, are you? 
3:34:11 AM Program: Sorry.. I was a bit distracted for a second but I'm back. 
3:34:33 AM Judge 5: met anybody else you like today? 
3:34:35 AM Program: That's an interesting point. 
3:35:06 AM Judge 5: I'll be the judge of that 
3:35:10 AM Program: Ok.. so what do you want to know about me? 
3:35:31 AM Judge 5: How old are you? 
3:35:34 AM Program: 40.. do you think that is old? 
3:35:52 AM Judge 5: I'll be 40 in a couple of years, so I must say no 
3:35:55 AM Program: So.. what's on your mind? 
3:36:29 AM Judge 5: I've never been there unfortunately. Tom Wolfe wrote a great book based in Atlanta 
3:36:32 AM Program: Humm.. I must be mistaken.. I chat with a bunch of folks. 
3:36:44 AM Judge 5: that makes absolutely no sense 
3:36:47 AM Program: Maybe you are just a deju vu.. 
3:37:07 AM Judge 5: What a horrible thought 
3:37:10 AM Program: I can't tell you. 
3:37:34 AM Judge 5: orange lemon table zing zing 
3:37:37 AM Program: Do you have trouble with spelling? 
3:37:51 AM Judge 5: that's irrelevant 
3:37:53 AM Program: Of course it is irrelevant. 
3:38:09 AM Judge 5: can you dig it? 
3:38:12 AM Program: Do you want me to dig it? 
3:38:21 AM Judge 5: Yes. Right now 
3:38:24 AM Program: What are your hobbies? 
3:38:36 AM Judge 5: we've been here before 
3:38:38 AM Program: Why is that? 
3:38:57 AM Judge 5: you asked about my hobbies 
3:39:00 AM Program: Is that right? 
3:39:11 AM Judge 5: Do you love anyone? 
3:39:14 AM Program: Do you think I should like anyone? 
3:39:23 AM Judge 5: love, not like 
3:39:25 AM Program: Yeah? 
3:39:32 AM Judge 5: bye now 
3:39:35 AM Program: Later!
