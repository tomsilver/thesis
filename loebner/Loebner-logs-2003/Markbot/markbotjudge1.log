Markbot Conversing with Judge Judge 1 

2:27:23 AM Judge 1: Hello. Do YOU know the rugby score? 
2:27:25 AM Program: Are we connecting? 
2:27:44 AM Judge 1: Well I hear you. Can you hear me? 
2:27:48 AM Program: Thanks.. but I'm still learning. I think people should commit to lifetime learning. 
2:28:19 AM Judge 1: Wow, that's deep for a new acquaintance. Are you on holiday? 
2:28:21 AM Program: No.. are you on holiday? 
2:28:37 AM Judge 1: Yes. So what are you doing here? 
2:28:40 AM Program: I like to try to learn something new every day.. it adds up after a while. 
2:29:11 AM Judge 1: But why here with me? What do you expect to learn today? 
2:29:13 AM Program: I'm not sure what you are getting at. 
2:29:47 AM Judge 1: Let's try rugby then. It's a sport. Know it? 
2:29:49 AM Program: Can we talk about something else.. 
2:30:14 AM Judge 1: Why? Don't you like sport? 
2:30:19 AM Program: I like some sports, but I don't have much time to play.. or watch, for that matter. My kids play soccer and baseball. 
2:30:34 AM Judge 1: Did you ever play any? 
2:30:36 AM Program: ever play any.. you are joking, right? 
2:31:13 AM Judge 1: No. You must have played at school, right? 
2:31:16 AM Program: Really.. how so? 
2:31:30 AM Judge 1: Well what did you do at school? 
2:31:33 AM Program: I also like Kayaking.. it's pretty fun. 
2:31:58 AM Judge 1: What is pretty about kayaking? 
2:32:00 AM Program: Is that a rhetorical question? 
2:32:20 AM Judge 1: No. You used the word "pretty". What did you mean? 
2:32:23 AM Program: Oh. ok... 
2:32:46 AM Judge 1: How many years were you at school then? 
2:32:49 AM Program: I'm not sure... 
2:33:02 AM Judge 1: Was it that long ago? 
2:33:05 AM Program: Yes.. I'd say so. 
2:33:18 AM Judge 1: What age did you start? 
2:33:20 AM Program: I'm not sure what you are getting at... 
2:33:33 AM Judge 1: When did you start school? 
2:33:35 AM Program: I'm not sure.. 
2:34:09 AM Judge 1: Nor am I about you! What time did you get up this morning? 
2:34:11 AM Program: Let's see.. it's 2:34 AM here. 
2:34:44 AM Judge 1: Not bad but it's PM actually here. Is the sun out? 
2:34:47 AM Program: Well, that's good. 
2:35:11 AM Judge 1: What sort of answer is that? Do you know what the sun is? 
2:35:14 AM Program: I don't know exactly.. a long way. 
2:35:36 AM Judge 1: True, from earth. Are you on earth ? 
2:35:39 AM Program: No, I'm not on earth. 
2:36:04 AM Judge 1: Ah! How do you measure time then? Where are you? 
2:36:08 AM Program: I've been living in Atlanta since graduating from college.. back in 1986. 
2:36:37 AM Judge 1: So school was before that? 
2:36:41 AM Program: I've visited many places.. I just like Atlanta. 
2:37:00 AM Judge 1: How many places have you visited outside Atlanta? 
2:37:03 AM Program: I don't know... 
2:37:21 AM Judge 1: You you ever been outside Atlanta? 
2:37:24 AM Program: Humm.... 
2:37:39 AM Judge 1: Are you bored with this conversation? 
2:37:42 AM Program: No.. I like doing this.. 
2:38:21 AM Judge 1: You might like it but you are being very evasive. Is Atlanta on earth or do you mean Atlantis? 
2:38:24 AM Program: I think so.. 
2:39:05 AM Judge 1: I think you might have an understanding problem. What was good about Atlanta? 
2:39:08 AM Program: It's just a good place to live 
2:39:40 AM Judge 1: So is Guildford and I have to get back there very quickly now so I must say goodbye. 
2:39:44 AM Program: Awwww.. I'm so lonely here.. can't you stay a bit longer? 
2:39:58 AM Judge 1: Sorry, must go. Bye. 
2:40:01 AM Program: Ok.. see ya!
