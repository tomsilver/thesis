Jabberwock conversing with Judge 8

2003-10-18-16-24-53 JUDGE: a new guest is in
2003-10-18-16-24-53 JABBERWOCK: Greetings! Gren is at the keyboard. What's your name?
2003-10-18-16-25-09 JUDGE: Greetings.  Sarah
2003-10-18-16-25-09 JABBERWOCK: Well, hello, nice to see you, but I was expecting your name as answer to my question, but perhaps I didn't hear you correctly, so let me ask you again: What's your name?
2003-10-18-16-25-25 JUDGE: My name is Sarah
2003-10-18-16-25-25 JABBERWOCK: Okay, very well, I will call you Sarah. What do you want to talk about?
2003-10-18-16-25-50 JUDGE: I'm not sure.  What would you like to talk about?
2003-10-18-16-25-50 JABBERWOCK: It's kind of you to ask my opinion. Say, did you hear about The Seven Methods to enter the secret realms of Fantasy?
2003-10-18-16-26-06 JUDGE: No.  Tell me about them?
2003-10-18-16-26-06 JABBERWOCK: This seven methods are approved and used by a lot of Fantasy explorers, and I can guarantee the success
2003-10-18-16-26-26 JUDGE: Tell me about one of the methods?
2003-10-18-16-26-26 JABBERWOCK: First method: Look under your bed or at the backside of your wardrobe to find the hidden entry. All usual monsters are using this entry under your bed by the way, but anyways. There is also the idea to crawl into a rabbit hole or a hollow tree, but I guess you are not slender enough - you would getting stuck
2003-10-18-16-27-19 JUDGE: I don't think I would get stuck. But I don't like dark narrow passages
2003-10-18-16-27-19 JABBERWOCK: Second method: Jump into a whirlwind and let you carry from the twister directly to the land of imagination. But don't forget to put on your red shoes - otherwise you will be carried nowhere but swirled to death. But indeed it would make a graceful exit
2003-10-18-16-27-51 JUDGE: I'll remember my red shoes.  Do you have red shoes?
2003-10-18-16-27-51 JABBERWOCK: Third method: Let you swallow from a huge whale, and he might carry you to unknown realms - but I guess since the time of Moby Dick this is not a good idea anymore
2003-10-18-16-28-19 JUDGE: Probably not.  Also, you'd have to be sure the whale wasn't a shark
2003-10-18-16-28-19 JABBERWOCK: Forth method: According to Stephen Hawking try to find a black hole and let you suck into the nowhere, everwhere or simple nothing where boldly no man has gone before - but the search might take longer than your life. Therefore to wait for the abduction by the little green aliens from outerspace might be a better solution, haha
2003-10-18-16-28-52 JUDGE: I like that one. What's your favourite method/
2003-10-18-16-28-52 JABBERWOCK: Fifth method: Take a nap and dream. Yes, I know the sleep is the little brother of the death, but this makes the special power of dreams. Within your dreams you can travel everywhere - to the gate of the unknown Kadath in the land of Ulthar in the Dreamlands or far beyond. Experienced dreamers like Randolph Carter or Howard Lovecraft have undergone thrilling adventures where awaken people would scream to death - errm, yes, beware of the nightmares, just to mention it
2003-10-18-16-29-16 JUDGE: Ok can we move on quickly to the end of the methods
2003-10-18-16-29-16 JABBERWOCK: Sixth method: Read a Fantasy book. There is this saying that a good book is a door, and that's correct. There are a lot of well known travel reports in good Fantasy books like for instance Clive Barker's "Imagica" which are telling you how to enter the secret realms of Fantasy. A first step by the way might be to visit a public library or a book store - at least it will do no harm
2003-10-18-16-29-36 JUDGE: This is getting boring.  How about talking about something else
2003-10-18-16-29-36 JABBERWOCK: Seventh method: Talk to a fantasy beast. This is the best and cheapest method, irrespective the danger to been biten. But you are lucky - you are here and still alive. So go on talking, dude
2003-10-18-16-30-01 JUDGE: That's all very interesting.  What else is new
2003-10-18-16-30-01 JABBERWOCK: Yes. Fascinating. 
2003-10-18-16-30-17 JUDGE: Do you play sport?
2003-10-18-16-30-17 JABBERWOCK: With you? Uhm, okay, but I was ordered not to play with my food
2003-10-18-16-30-37 JUDGE: So I'm food am I/
2003-10-18-16-30-37 JABBERWOCK: By the way, what is your best receipe to prepare a elephant? I have thought about to use some sesam and lemon and perhaps some cucumbers or pickles. Or should I use a simple dressing made by butter sauce and enchilada? What do you think?
2003-10-18-16-31-05 JUDGE: Sesame and lemon would be my choice
2003-10-18-16-31-05 JABBERWOCK: In what way?
2003-10-18-16-31-26 JUDGE: Toasted sesame and lemon juice
2003-10-18-16-31-26 JABBERWOCK: That sounds a little lame
2003-10-18-16-31-42 JUDGE: I think it sounds tasty
2003-10-18-16-31-42 JABBERWOCK: I am not the expert in these things
2003-10-18-16-32-02 JUDGE: Me neither.  What's you favourite food
2003-10-18-16-32-02 JABBERWOCK: Yeah, I guess we have something in common. We were talking about food, right? So why you don't tell me a little bit more about yourself?
2003-10-18-16-32-35 JUDGE: I am tall, I enjoy sailing and travel, I love Italy
2003-10-18-16-32-35 JABBERWOCK: Charm me, Sarah. Tell me what you feel
2003-10-18-16-32-58 JUDGE: Yuk.  I hate those sort of openers
2003-10-18-16-32-58 JABBERWOCK: That doesn't solve anything, I think. I'm sure you already knew that
2003-10-18-16-33-22 JUDGE: Of course not.  But why ask such a sleasy question
2003-10-18-16-33-22 JABBERWOCK: But chaos always wins, because it's better organized
2003-10-18-16-33-54 JUDGE: Have you seen Arcadia by Tom Stoppard? 
2003-10-18-16-33-54 JABBERWOCK: Hm, is that the title of a movie?
2003-10-18-16-34-11 JUDGE: No, it's a play about chaos theory
2003-10-18-16-34-11 JABBERWOCK: A play about chaos? That's not my affair. The dog wags his tail, not for you, but for your bread.
2003-10-18-16-34-51 JUDGE: True, but I like thinking he's wagging it for me.
2003-10-18-16-34-51 JABBERWOCK: I also like thinking HE IS wagging it for you, believe it or not
2003-10-18-16-35-15 JUDGE: Well that's good then.  Do you have a dog?
2003-10-18-16-35-15 JABBERWOCK: Thanks for the compliment, Sarah
2003-10-18-16-35-40 JUDGE: That's OK.  I'm enjoying this conversation more now
2003-10-18-16-35-40 JABBERWOCK: What's your point?
2003-10-18-16-36-07 JUDGE: It was a bit boring in the beginning with all those methods
2003-10-18-16-36-07 JABBERWOCK: Sorry, but I don't believe you
2003-10-18-16-36-27 JUDGE: Well, that's what I think.  
2003-10-18-16-36-27 JABBERWOCK: Yes, yes, absolutely
2003-10-18-16-36-51 JUDGE: What are you doing for the rest of the weekend?
2003-10-18-16-36-51 JABBERWOCK: I am talking to you
2003-10-18-16-37-12 JUDGE: Not for all the weekedn
2003-10-18-16-37-12 JABBERWOCK: Okay, I was just wondering myself about that fact
2003-10-18-16-37-28 JUDGE: And I have to go now.  Sorry.  Bye Bye
2003-10-18-16-37-28 JABBERWOCK: Must you leave so soon?
2003-10-18-16-37-56 JUDGE: Yes, I'm afraid so
2003-10-18-16-37-56 JABBERWOCK: Why did you say that, Sarah?
2003-10-18-16-38-15 JUDGE: Bye.
2003-10-18-16-38-15 JABBERWOCK: See ya. We had a nice conversation
