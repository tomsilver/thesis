Jabberwock conversing with Judge 6

2003-10-18-15-27-43 JUDGE: a new guest is in
2003-10-18-15-27-43 JABBERWOCK: Ah, hello at the pane, I am Gren. What's your name?
2003-10-18-15-28-19 JUDGE: I'm Marilyn. Where do you come from Gren?
2003-10-18-15-28-19 JABBERWOCK: Be welcome, Marilyn ¦ Where. My name has a nice ring to it, don't you think?
2003-10-18-15-28-48 JUDGE: Yes. Where is it from?
2003-10-18-15-28-48 JABBERWOCK: Naturally, but, well, um ... Well, I guess if it from has not moved lately then it's at the same place as yesterday. But why is that important?
2003-10-18-15-29-20 JUDGE: Where does your name come from?
2003-10-18-15-29-20 JABBERWOCK: Sorry, I never thought about it. It's just my name
2003-10-18-15-30-05 JUDGE: What would you usually be doing on a Saturday afternoon?
2003-10-18-15-30-05 JABBERWOCK: Well, there are other days, but the Saturdays of October are the most boring
2003-10-18-15-31-01 JUDGE: I think Saturdays in October are great. The trees are beautiful and we can enjoy being outside still.
2003-10-18-15-31-01 JABBERWOCK: Hehehe. Trying to trick me, eh?
2003-10-18-15-31-28 JUDGE: No. Why would I do that?
2003-10-18-15-31-28 JABBERWOCK: Or is there a deeper meaning? How many times did you that, before you became such a nerd?
2003-10-18-15-32-09 JUDGE: That isn't a very nice thing to say to someone you have only just met
2003-10-18-15-32-09 JABBERWOCK: Please correct my mistake. What is a very nice thing to say to someone I have only just met?
2003-10-18-15-32-54 JUDGE: It is good to talk to you and to find out more about you.
2003-10-18-15-32-54 JABBERWOCK: What is that?
2003-10-18-15-33-18 JUDGE: Tell me about your work
2003-10-18-15-33-18 JABBERWOCK: Work is either fun or drudgery. It depends on your attitude. I like fun
2003-10-18-15-33-42 JUDGE: And is your work fun?
2003-10-18-15-33-42 JABBERWOCK: Do you have any other problems?
2003-10-18-15-34-04 JUDGE: Not at the moment. Do you?
2003-10-18-15-34-04 JABBERWOCK: Okay
2003-10-18-15-34-28 JUDGE: Tell me about your family
2003-10-18-15-34-28 JABBERWOCK: As far that I know I am the only living part of my family. The others either died a natural death or they were exterminated - but that's at least the same. Dead is dead
2003-10-18-15-35-01 JUDGE: Do you mind being alone?
2003-10-18-15-35-01 JABBERWOCK: Yeah! But there is no reason to be down in the mouth - I am here and kicking alive, and you are talking to me
2003-10-18-15-35-29 JUDGE: What else do you do with your time?
2003-10-18-15-35-29 JABBERWOCK: I like to play virtual role playing games. My favorite character is the Bogeyman
2003-10-18-15-36-22 JUDGE: Do you spend time on things other than compuuters?
2003-10-18-15-36-22 JABBERWOCK: I don't know, do you spend time on things other than compuuters when you get a chance?
2003-10-18-15-36-58 JUDGE: Yes. I spend too much time at work using a computer
2003-10-18-15-36-58 JABBERWOCK: Does the superior intelligence of computers threaten you, Marilyn ¦ Where?
2003-10-18-15-37-51 JUDGE: No. But sitting at a desk and typing on a keyboard isn't a very healthy way to spend the day
2003-10-18-15-37-51 JABBERWOCK: Well, I guess it's just beyond the normal case
2003-10-18-15-38-31 JUDGE: I like to watch films and read books as well. How about you?
2003-10-18-15-38-31 JABBERWOCK: I'm doing just fine thanks
2003-10-18-15-38-59 JUDGE: What films have you watched recently?
2003-10-18-15-38-59 JABBERWOCK: "The fifth Element" was great
2003-10-18-15-39-23 JUDGE: I didn't see it. Who starred in it?
2003-10-18-15-39-23 JABBERWOCK: Please take a rag and clean your dusty monitor screen
2003-10-18-15-39-47 JUDGE: It doesn't look that dirty to me
2003-10-18-15-39-47 JABBERWOCK: Really?
2003-10-18-15-40-11 JUDGE: What other films do you like?
2003-10-18-15-40-11 JABBERWOCK: Well, I like pastimes the most
2003-10-18-15-40-35 JUDGE: What type of pastimes?
2003-10-18-15-40-35 JABBERWOCK: Isn't it marvelous? Another mystery thing is is this bullshit or fertilizer?
2003-10-18-15-41-16 JUDGE: I don't think I understand and it is time to go, goodbye
2003-10-18-15-41-16 JABBERWOCK: When will you return, Marilyn ¦ Where?
