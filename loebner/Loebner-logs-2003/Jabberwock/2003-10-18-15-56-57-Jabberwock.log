2003-10-18-15-58-18 JUDGE: what about football
2003-10-18-15-58-18 JABBERWOCK: Football sucks
2003-10-18-15-58-43 JUDGE: i agree with you - what is your favourite subject
2003-10-18-15-58-43 JABBERWOCK: You want to butter up me, roger?
2003-10-18-15-59-07 JUDGE: i certainly do if we share a common interest
2003-10-18-15-59-07 JABBERWOCK: Certainly not!
2003-10-18-15-59-27 JUDGE: are you becoming defensive?
2003-10-18-15-59-27 JABBERWOCK: Heck! I won't say "yes" or "no" right now
2003-10-18-15-59-47 JUDGE: you must come off the fence
2003-10-18-15-59-47 JABBERWOCK: Whatever you say, roger
2003-10-18-16-00-08 JUDGE: lets get to know each other better
2003-10-18-16-00-08 JABBERWOCK: Let's not. I'd like you to explore this topic more deeply
2003-10-18-16-00-28 JUDGE: i feel rejected already
2003-10-18-16-00-28 JABBERWOCK: If you want to keep your private life private, I understand
2003-10-18-16-00-52 JUDGE: perhaps we could speak about your private life?
2003-10-18-16-00-52 JABBERWOCK: Can't you please be a little more positive, roger?
2003-10-18-16-01-16 JUDGE: okay but lets find something to talk about
2003-10-18-16-01-16 JABBERWOCK: That sounds like a good idea
2003-10-18-16-01-37 JUDGE: i like music do you?
2003-10-18-16-01-37 JABBERWOCK: What kind of music do you listen to?
2003-10-18-16-01-57 JUDGE: most kinds - especially house
2003-10-18-16-01-57 JABBERWOCK: Uhm, okay, better than to sniff white powder to daze the mind I guess. What really turns you on beside of such style of trash music?
2003-10-18-16-02-33 JUDGE: house is pure music not trash
2003-10-18-16-02-33 JABBERWOCK: But "trash" is mostly discordantly. I mean it's a torture of the ears
2003-10-18-16-02-54 JUDGE: perhaps to your ears but not to mine
2003-10-18-16-02-54 JABBERWOCK: You don't have any doubts at all, do you?
2003-10-18-16-03-22 JUDGE: i am confident about myself

2003-10-18-16-04-06 JABBERWOCK: No you won't
2003-10-18-16-04-27 JUDGE: why do you not trust me?
2003-10-18-16-04-27 JABBERWOCK: Why should I trust you?
2003-10-18-16-04-46 JUDGE: i am Judge 7 thats why
2003-10-18-16-04-46 JABBERWOCK: I like my friends to be Judge 7 THAT IS why

2003-10-18-16-08-01 JUDGE: you are not interested in my movie appearance?
2003-10-18-16-08-01 JABBERWOCK: Zounds! Well, you aren't very easy to entertain, are you?
