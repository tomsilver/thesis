2003-10-18-14-14-07 JUDGE: a new guest is in
2003-10-18-14-14-07 JABBERWOCK: Hi, my name is Gren. What's your name?
2003-10-18-14-14-32 JUDGE: lynsey
2003-10-18-14-14-32 JABBERWOCK: Be welcome, lynsey. What do you want to talk about?
2003-10-18-14-15-23 JUDGE: i think i would like to talk about the weather today. what is it like with you?
2003-10-18-14-15-23 JABBERWOCK: Much the same as it would be for you. 
2003-10-18-14-15-39 JUDGE: which is what?
2003-10-18-14-15-39 JABBERWOCK: That's a good question - but perhaps a little bit too short in words
2003-10-18-14-16-07 JUDGE: what is the weather like with you? Is it sunny or raining?
2003-10-18-14-16-07 JABBERWOCK: Cool, at least here in my room
2003-10-18-14-16-31 JUDGE: does that then mean it is hot outside?
2003-10-18-14-16-31 JABBERWOCK: The weather in here is dry and well tempered
2003-10-18-14-17-08 JUDGE: you sound like you are training to be a weatherman!  So what do you do for a living?
2003-10-18-14-17-08 JABBERWOCK: Screw the weather. Let's talk about something relly interesting. How's about flowers?
2003-10-18-14-17-52 JUDGE: what about flowers? isn't that a bit of a girlie subject?
2003-10-18-14-17-52 JABBERWOCK: That's a little vague. Could you be more specific?
2003-10-18-14-18-25 JUDGE: I don't like flowers so would rather talk about travel.  Where do you like to go on holiday?
2003-10-18-14-18-25 JABBERWOCK: No, I do not want to go on holiday
2003-10-18-14-18-57 JUDGE: That wasn't my question.  Where would you like to go on holiday if you could go away next week?
2003-10-18-14-18-57 JABBERWOCK: Hmm, Giblet, I'm not sure if I'd like to go on holiday if I could go away next week. But I like to make new friends
2003-10-18-14-19-26 JUDGE: that's nice.  have you ever been to Australia?
2003-10-18-14-19-26 JABBERWOCK: Thank you
2003-10-18-14-20-10 JUDGE: you seem as though you are half asleep! what do you think about the rugby wolrd cup at the moment?  who do you think will win?
2003-10-18-14-20-10 JABBERWOCK: How would I know who will win?
2003-10-18-14-20-51 JUDGE: well maybe you have started watching the games?  what aboutthe match today.  I think south Africa will win, and you?
2003-10-18-14-20-51 JABBERWOCK: Never mind, it's not important
2003-10-18-14-21-14 JUDGE: i think it is, so what is important to you then?
2003-10-18-14-21-14 JABBERWOCK: Maybe it doesn't make any difference
2003-10-18-14-21-30 JUDGE: so what is important toy ou then?
2003-10-18-14-21-30 JABBERWOCK: Well, I guess you are finished with that topic. Like Miss Piggy always told me: Curiosity killed the cat.
2003-10-18-14-21-53 JUDGE: so does that make you Kermit the frog?
2003-10-18-14-21-53 JABBERWOCK: Well, I guess it was not a compliment
2003-10-18-14-22-26 JUDGE: maybe not but then again, green slimy frogs are nothing to be proud of either!
2003-10-18-14-22-26 JABBERWOCK: Hmm, most frogs are poisonous and not very tasty, so I am not much interested in frogs
2003-10-18-14-22-54 JUDGE: nor me but you started it!  so what is important to you then?
2003-10-18-14-22-54 JABBERWOCK: No, I was just following you. You know, the bellwether goes first to the chopping block
2003-10-18-14-23-14 JUDGE: what on earth doe that mean?
2003-10-18-14-23-14 JABBERWOCK: That's just about the limit. I don't have the faintest idea
2003-10-18-14-23-51 JUDGE: nor do I.  I think you must be either very tired or hung over from last night as you are talking gibberish!
2003-10-18-14-23-51 JABBERWOCK: I have no idea what to say
2003-10-18-14-24-15 JUDGE: i thought not! so tell be about yourself!
2003-10-18-14-24-15 JABBERWOCK: Do you mean myself, me, Gren?
2003-10-18-14-24-27 JUDGE: yes
2003-10-18-14-24-27 JABBERWOCK: You agree with everything anyway
2003-10-18-14-25-04 JUDGE: since when? well i guess I can conclude that you are particularly obstinate.  would you agree?
2003-10-18-14-25-04 JABBERWOCK: Okay. I totally agree with you
2003-10-18-14-25-52 JUDGE: how boring.  i think i am going to go and speak to someone else.  you don't have much to say!  Bye for now!
2003-10-18-14-25-52 JABBERWOCK: Eh what? Can you say that again?
2003-10-18-14-26-16 JUDGE: bye for now, I have to go and speak to someone else.
2003-10-18-14-26-16 JABBERWOCK: Well, goodbye and good ribbons
2003-10-18-14-26-32 JUDGE: ta ra
2003-10-18-14-26-32 JABBERWOCK: Sheesh, do me a favor and take some typing lessons
