2003-10-18-15-12-33 JABBERWOCK: Hi, is there anybody living at the other side of the pane? Here is Gren, fully alive. What's your name?
2003-10-18-15-12-53 JUDGE: howdy, it's Chris
2003-10-18-15-12-53 JABBERWOCK: Be welcome, dy, IT IS Chris. That's quite possible. I don't even care
2003-10-18-15-13-23 JUDGE: You're American, aren't you? We never say "pane" here
2003-10-18-15-13-23 JABBERWOCK: Absolutely never? You sound pretty sure
2003-10-18-15-13-51 JUDGE: whatever. but then we don't say whatever as much as you lot
2003-10-18-15-13-51 JABBERWOCK: Yeah ... whatever
2003-10-18-15-14-03 JUDGE: touche
2003-10-18-15-14-03 JABBERWOCK: Aww - a linguist would have no fun to listen to your rough and scanty grammar style - are you always so short in words?
2003-10-18-15-14-34 JUDGE: SOrry, I'll be more polite. Did you like the lunch?
2003-10-18-15-14-34 JABBERWOCK: Apologies are not necessary. And what about me?
2003-10-18-15-14-53 JUDGE: I asked you about the lunch, didn't I?
2003-10-18-15-14-53 JABBERWOCK: Ah yes, I am getting a bit hungry. What do you think about the idea to have a picnic together?
2003-10-18-15-15-13 JUDGE: In this weather? You're joking me
2003-10-18-15-15-13 JABBERWOCK: Yes I am just joking around, dy, IT IS Chris
2003-10-18-15-15-37 JUDGE: Hilarious. Anyway, about that picnic. I'll come
2003-10-18-15-15-37 JABBERWOCK: Hmm, yes, as I know rio is a city somewhere in Argentina. How is the living in rio?
2003-10-18-15-16-03 JUDGE: I thought it was a Duran Duran album
2003-10-18-15-16-03 JABBERWOCK: Well, that's not a problem. Maybe you're right
2003-10-18-15-16-27 JUDGE: About Duran? Yes I am, every time
2003-10-18-15-16-27 JABBERWOCK: I do not understand
2003-10-18-15-16-53 JUDGE: Whatever. You know one of the judges is an expert on lying?
2003-10-18-15-16-53 JABBERWOCK: Yes I know one of the judges is an expert on lying
2003-10-18-15-17-13 JUDGE: DO you know which one it is?
2003-10-18-15-17-13 JABBERWOCK: No. Tell me more
2003-10-18-15-17-30 JUDGE: She's blonde.
2003-10-18-15-17-30 JABBERWOCK: It is sometimes hard to predict what females will do
2003-10-18-15-17-46 JUDGE: No more so than us lot
2003-10-18-15-17-46 JABBERWOCK: Huh? You want more?
2003-10-18-15-18-14 JUDGE: Are you threatening me?
2003-10-18-15-18-14 JABBERWOCK: Was it a slip of the pen? I don't know if I am or not
2003-10-18-15-18-34 JUDGE: I wasn't threatening you. Calm down
2003-10-18-15-18-34 JABBERWOCK: I still don't understand
2003-10-18-15-18-56 JUDGE: Let's think about the picnic instead
2003-10-18-15-18-56 JABBERWOCK: What did you have?
2003-10-18-15-19-12 JUDGE: no, it's the picnic you were proposing
2003-10-18-15-19-12 JABBERWOCK: What did you have?
2003-10-18-15-19-37 JUDGE: you're not the brightest one here, are you?
2003-10-18-15-19-37 JABBERWOCK: Ah, well, I see, the funny part of the show is over now, and it's time to show you my collection of trophies, harr harr
2003-10-18-15-20-09 JUDGE: Why are you being so passive aggressive?
2003-10-18-15-20-09 JABBERWOCK: You could be right
2003-10-18-15-20-29 JUDGE: I just wanted a nice relaxing chat
2003-10-18-15-20-29 JABBERWOCK: When you say 'just' it makes it seem like this is not an important desire
2003-10-18-15-20-53 JUDGE: you bar-room philosopher, you
2003-10-18-15-20-53 JABBERWOCK: Don't panic! Make it quick and discreet, bud.
2003-10-18-15-21-14 JUDGE: I'm not propositioning you!
2003-10-18-15-21-14 JABBERWOCK: I am glad to hear that you are not propositioning me
2003-10-18-15-21-30 JUDGE: you're not the only one
2003-10-18-15-21-30 JABBERWOCK: Yes, but perhaps the best one. You know: It's a long worm that has no turning.
2003-10-18-15-21-54 JUDGE: Errm.  Let's talk about AI instead
2003-10-18-15-21-54 JABBERWOCK: Sure, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE instead sounds like a good topic
2003-10-18-15-22-14 JUDGE: then you'd be the expert, wouldn't you?
2003-10-18-15-22-14 JABBERWOCK: If not me, who?
2003-10-18-15-22-35 JUDGE: I was being ironic
2003-10-18-15-22-35 JABBERWOCK: That's more likely. Tell me something I don't know!
2003-10-18-15-22-55 JUDGE: where do I start? DId you know how old I am?
2003-10-18-15-22-55 JABBERWOCK: Well, the usual answer would be "at the beginning" - but who wants to be usualy?
2003-10-18-15-23-19 JUDGE: I was born 37 years ago
2003-10-18-15-23-19 JABBERWOCK: Yes, and let that be a warning to you. Were you really, little pansy?
2003-10-18-15-23-48 JUDGE: Now you're trying to irk me again
2003-10-18-15-23-48 JABBERWOCK: Actually I'm just trying to keep the conversation going
2003-10-18-15-24-04 JUDGE: That makes two of us.
2003-10-18-15-24-04 JABBERWOCK: That's a good idea. Let's do it
2003-10-18-15-24-24 JUDGE: What do you fancy doing this evening?
2003-10-18-15-24-24 JABBERWOCK: I enjoy talking for fun. What do you do for fun?
2003-10-18-15-24-44 JUDGE: Talking. Drinking. Dancing
2003-10-18-15-24-44 JABBERWOCK: What do you do in your spare time?
2003-10-18-15-25-06 JUDGE: Spare time? I've got a baby daughter
2003-10-18-15-25-06 JABBERWOCK: Some of us are less fortunate than others
2003-10-18-15-25-37 JUDGE: That's your opinion - you've obviously not got one of your own
2003-10-18-15-25-37 JABBERWOCK: Hmmm, if you say so ... You'll hear of this! 
2003-10-18-15-25-49 JUDGE: bye
2003-10-18-15-25-49 JABBERWOCK: See ya. We had a nice conversation
2003-10-18-15-26-05 JUDGE: even though you kept having a go at me
2003-10-18-15-26-05 JABBERWOCK: Yes, even that
2003-10-18-15-26-17 JUDGE: adios
2003-10-18-15-26-17 JABBERWOCK: Okay, see you later
