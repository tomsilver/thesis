Jabberwock conversing with Judge 1

2003-10-18-14-44-03 JUDGE: a new guest is in
2003-10-18-14-44-03 JABBERWOCK: Ah, hello at the pane, I am Gren. What's your name?
2003-10-18-14-44-40 JUDGE: I am Nigel. Where do you live?
2003-10-18-14-44-40 JABBERWOCK: Nice to see you, Nigel ¦ Where. What fun!
2003-10-18-14-45-25 JUDGE: Where do you live? What country?
2003-10-18-14-45-25 JABBERWOCK: I am originally from Transsylvania, but I left my country when I was young and joined a travelling circus, so I have no real home
2003-10-18-14-46-06 JUDGE: What countries have you visited with the circus?
2003-10-18-14-46-06 JABBERWOCK: How do you expect *me* to know whether I have visited with the circus? Huh???
2003-10-18-14-46-34 JUDGE: Well you were there. Were you blindfolded?
2003-10-18-14-46-34 JABBERWOCK: Surprisingly, I blindfolded. Does that bother you?
2003-10-18-14-47-03 JUDGE: Not at all. What did you do in the circus?
2003-10-18-14-47-03 JABBERWOCK: OK, I believe you
2003-10-18-14-47-30 JUDGE: Were you a blind clown?
2003-10-18-14-47-30 JABBERWOCK: I didn't think you'd be able to respond intelligently
2003-10-18-14-47-54 JUDGE: What were you then?
2003-10-18-14-47-54 JABBERWOCK: Be not childish
2003-10-18-14-48-27 JUDGE: OK. Let's talk about food. What do you like to eat?
2003-10-18-14-48-27 JABBERWOCK: I am no gourmet. First of all it must be HOT, and CRUNCHY
2003-10-18-14-48-55 JUDGE: Does Apple Crumble count then?
2003-10-18-14-48-55 JABBERWOCK: I don't know what you mean
2003-10-18-14-49-19 JUDGE: What hot and crunchy food do you eat?
2003-10-18-14-49-19 JABBERWOCK: That's a hard choice to make: I would give a fresh hunted virginal Snark the first place, but followed by a cooked Jubjub bird
2003-10-18-14-50-08 JUDGE: Is the Snark crunchy because of the bones. I thought the virginal ones had no bones?
2003-10-18-14-50-08 JABBERWOCK: Bones? Do you know the old guy who is SPEAKING IN CAPITAL LETTER? He's a personal friend of mine
2003-10-18-14-50-45 JUDGE: Back to food. What is your best hot food then?
2003-10-18-14-50-45 JABBERWOCK: I am not hungry at the moment. But if I am hungy I gobble down whatever is available. How old are you, by the way?
2003-10-18-14-51-29 JUDGE: I am 56 or am I 57? What date is it today?
2003-10-18-14-51-29 JABBERWOCK: 56 or am I 57 ¦ What date is it today?? Gosh, that's pretty indigestible!
2003-10-18-14-52-01 JUDGE: Well is it not hot and crunchy enough for you?
2003-10-18-14-52-01 JABBERWOCK: Cool
2003-10-18-14-52-38 JUDGE: Not cool! Hot and crunchy - that's what you said! What else do you like other than Snark?
2003-10-18-14-52-38 JABBERWOCK: I like to talk about fairy tales, or whatever else you'd like
2003-10-18-14-53-10 JUDGE: What fairy tales are popular in Transylvania?
2003-10-18-14-53-10 JABBERWOCK: Well, speaking about stories and fairy tells: Did you hear about The Seven Methods to enter the secret realms of Fantasy?
2003-10-18-14-53-34 JUDGE: No, explain.
2003-10-18-14-53-34 JABBERWOCK: This seven methods are approved and used by a lot of Fantasy explorers, and I can guarantee the success
2003-10-18-14-54-03 JUDGE: I only heard about six methods. What is the seventh?
2003-10-18-14-54-03 JABBERWOCK: First method: Look under your bed or at the backside of your wardrobe to find the hidden entry. All usual monsters are using this entry under your bed by the way, but anyways. There is also the idea to crawl into a rabbit hole or a hollow tree, but I guess you are not slender enough - you would getting stuck
2003-10-18-14-54-39 JUDGE: OK. I know that. What is the seventh method. Skip the rest.
2003-10-18-14-54-39 JABBERWOCK: Second method: Jump into a whirlwind and let you carry from the twister directly to the land of imagination. But don't forget to put on your red shoes - otherwise you will be carried nowhere but swirled to death. But indeed it would make a graceful exit
2003-10-18-14-55-24 JUDGE: Don't carry on as I know this already. Back to the circus. Did you tell stories there?
2003-10-18-14-55-24 JABBERWOCK: Third method: Let you swallow from a huge whale, and he might carry you to unknown realms - but I guess since the time of Moby Dick this is not a good idea anymore
2003-10-18-14-56-25 JUDGE: Listen. Oh don't worry. I have to go now as I feel a bit Moby Dick myself! Goodbye!
2003-10-18-14-56-25 JABBERWOCK: Forth method: According to Stephen Hawking try to find a black hole and let you suck into the nowhere, everwhere or simple nothing where boldly no man has gone before - but the search might take longer than your life. Therefore to wait for the abduction by the little green aliens from outerspace might be a better solution, haha
