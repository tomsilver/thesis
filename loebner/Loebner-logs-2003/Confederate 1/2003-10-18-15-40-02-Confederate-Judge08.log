Confederate conversing with Judge 08

2003-10-18-15-40-31 CONFEDERATE: Good day to you. How are you, and why?
2003-10-18-15-41-04 JUDGE: Good day. I am well - it's a lovely day and I'm having fun
2003-10-18-15-41-57 CONFEDERATE: I'm pleaqsed to hear it. I think you don't do philosophy though - otherwise you'd have picked up on the why. Never mind. We'd be better off out of dorrs, wouldn't we?
2003-10-18-15-42-21 JUDGE: I thought I had!  Anyway, yes, I guess we would be better off out doors
2003-10-18-15-42-52 CONFEDERATE: Why not ask The Powers The Be if they'd mind shifting this lot out onto the lawn?
2003-10-18-15-43-14 JUDGE: Worth a try, but I don't suppose we'd get anywhere.  Where you here all morning too?
2003-10-18-15-43-54 CONFEDERATE: No, I was digging the first parsnips. Best ever! The hot summer seems to have done them a power of good.
2003-10-18-15-44-05 JUDGE: Excellent.  Where's your garden?
2003-10-18-15-44-38 CONFEDERATE: Behind the house. Where's yours? ASSUMING YOU HAVE ONE THAT IS.
2003-10-18-15-45-06 JUDGE: Yes, our's is behind the house too.  But no parsnips
2003-10-18-15-45-31 CONFEDERATE: Do I take it that you're also a keen gardener?
2003-10-18-15-46-12 JUDGE: Sort of.  But I don't get enough time.  We do a lot of sailing in the summer, so that's the weekends sorted.
2003-10-18-15-47-10 CONFEDERATE: And winter isn't really the gardening season - although the sailing can be good they tell me. I'm always see sick when I'm on board. It's a right pain.
2003-10-18-15-48-06 JUDGE: True. It can be a bit rough in the winter.  
2003-10-18-15-48-40 CONFEDERATE: Where have you sailed to?
2003-10-18-15-49-04 JUDGE: This year we went down to Weymouth, but we've also been across to France and down to the West Country
2003-10-18-15-49-29 CONFEDERATE: They have sea down there then do they?
2003-10-18-15-49-54 JUDGE: Think so!  What did you do for your holiday this year?
2003-10-18-15-50-35 CONFEDERATE: Went to Canada, San Francisco, Normandy, St Petersburg, Helsinki and Grenoble.
2003-10-18-15-50-57 JUDGE: Wow.  You must get a lot of holiday time.  Which was best?
2003-10-18-15-51-32 CONFEDERATE: How about telling me your favourite (short) joke.
2003-10-18-15-51-57 JUDGE: Well, mine's how did the punk rocker cross the road (but I think someone's told a similar one today already)
2003-10-18-15-52-39 CONFEDERATE: Not me. Let's think...no, I can't guess. Tell me: how DID the punk rocker cross the road?
2003-10-18-15-52-51 JUDGE: Because it was stapled to the chicken
2003-10-18-15-53-37 CONFEDERATE: OK. Not that good, but at least it was short. I only know long jokes. I think I enjoyed Helsinki the best. Very civilised.
2003-10-18-15-53-54 JUDGE: Got to go now.  Nice to talk to you.  Bye
2003-10-18-15-54-12 CONFEDERATE: Tatty bye as they say up north.
