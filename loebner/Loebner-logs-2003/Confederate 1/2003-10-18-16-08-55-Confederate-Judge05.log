Confederate conversing with Judge 05

2003-10-18-16-09-26 CONFEDERATE: Good morning. What shall we talk about?
2003-10-18-16-09-35 JUDGE: it's the afternoon
2003-10-18-16-10-09 CONFEDERATE: Not in The Chatham Islands.
2003-10-18-16-10-20 JUDGE: where are they?
2003-10-18-16-11-08 CONFEDERATE: In the Roaring Forties, 500 miles E of New Zealand. If you were Californian, would you have voted for a second rate film star?
2003-10-18-16-11-57 JUDGE: do you mean arnie? or ronald?
2003-10-18-16-12-19 CONFEDERATE: Aha. Yes, a good reply. Both I suppose. Well, would you?
2003-10-18-16-12-37 JUDGE: definitely not. And you?
2003-10-18-16-13-16 CONFEDERATE: No. Just because they look good (??) on screen doesn't mean they know how to govern.
2003-10-18-16-13-32 JUDGE: I take it you're American
2003-10-18-16-14-17 CONFEDERATE: Take that back at once! Are you? Do you eat "freedom fries"?
2003-10-18-16-14-53 JUDGE: certainly not! I've spent too long this afternoon talking to YankBots
2003-10-18-16-15-41 CONFEDERATE: Oh aye. It gets to you after a while. Why are you here, just out of interest?
2003-10-18-16-16-18 JUDGE: I'm doing some work with Surrey at the mo and they asked me. Seemed like a laugh but it's a long trip down from the Midlands
2003-10-18-16-17-05 CONFEDERATE: But worth it. Think of the free lunch. They don't have those in the Black Country do they?
2003-10-18-16-17-24 JUDGE: That's West Midlands - the home of Heavy Metal. I'm Nottingham
2003-10-18-16-18-25 CONFEDERATE: Lucky Nottingham. A teacher told me once that this town was named after a Mr Snott. Is this true?

2003-10-18-16-19-24 CONFEDERATE: We seem to have suffered yet another interruption. The technology isn't working too well. As you were saying...?
2003-10-18-16-19-46 JUDGE: sorry, I was saying The West Midlands is the home of Heavy Metal
2003-10-18-16-20-21 CONFEDERATE: OK. And I was saying that a teacher told me once that Nottingham was named after a Mr Snott. Is this true?
2003-10-18-16-20-55 JUDGE: Yes quite true. Oh, that's the bell.  Where are you from?
2003-10-18-16-21-13 CONFEDERATE: From the other side of beyond...Byeeeeee
2003-10-18-16-21-20 JUDGE: see ya
2003-10-18-16-21-27 CONFEDERATE: tara
