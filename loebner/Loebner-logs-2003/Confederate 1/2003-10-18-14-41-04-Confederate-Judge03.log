2003-10-18-14-41-31 CONFEDERATE: Good afternoon Mr/Ms Judge3. Who are you?
2003-10-18-14-41-53 JUDGE: i am judge number 3 and you?
2003-10-18-14-42-28 CONFEDERATE: I am just some guy. Are you enjoying yourself? I'm finding this interface a bit slow.
2003-10-18-14-42-43 JUDGE: i thought you were just a slow typer.  most men are!
2003-10-18-14-44-12 CONFEDERATE: Oh yes? And I was thinking it was just the interface. Why are you here?
2003-10-18-14-44-40 JUDGE: well i kind of was asked to come along today and be one of the judges.  what are you doing here?
2003-10-18-14-45-14 CONFEDERATE: Just being me. As if I could be anything else. Do you do this kind of thign for a living?
2003-10-18-14-45-36 JUDGE: no.  i tend to like spending weekends going shopping actually.
2003-10-18-14-46-14 CONFEDERATE: You must have too much money. Think how much you'll save this weekend. I think you're a woman: am I right?
2003-10-18-14-46-33 JUDGE: possibly I guess the shopping thing might have given it away slightly
2003-10-18-14-47-10 CONFEDERATE: Not true. Blokes have to shop sometimes too you know. It's just that they don't enjoy it. Speaking for myself anyway.
2003-10-18-14-47-22 JUDGE: so what do you like doing then?
2003-10-18-14-47-39 CONFEDERATE: Cycling.
2003-10-18-14-47-55 JUDGE: what type of cycling, racing or mountain biking?
2003-10-18-14-48-37 CONFEDERATE: Best described as cycling for transport, i.e. neither of the above. Pity about the business of the roads around here though. Do you cycle?
2003-10-18-14-49-00 JUDGE: no. i drive as i hate getting cold and public transport.  do you have a car?
2003-10-18-14-49-37 CONFEDERATE: Nope. Got rid of it 4 years ago. Don't need it and there was nowhere to park anyway.
2003-10-18-14-49-58 JUDGE: that depends really.  so what do you do for fun?
2003-10-18-14-50-48 CONFEDERATE: Annoy the neighbs by playing the piano. Garden. Walk. All the usual things. And you?
2003-10-18-14-51-24 JUDGE: well shopping obviously and going out drinking of course.  I also like walking although not when the weather gets too cold.
2003-10-18-14-51-58 CONFEDERATE: I think you like heat. So you must have enjoyed August if you were in England.
2003-10-18-14-52-20 JUDGE: i was away on holiday.  where do you go on holiday? do you like travelling?
2003-10-18-14-53-00 CONFEDERATE: Very much. I went to Finland in June. I can recommend it highly.
2003-10-18-14-53-29 JUDGE: I thought people in Finland were boring? I might go there now.  I have to go now so nice talking to you.
2003-10-18-14-53-55 CONFEDERATE: Nice talking to you (apart from the shopping) (Oh, and the car)
2003-10-18-14-54-23 JUDGE: cheers mate!
2003-10-18-14-54-57 CONFEDERATE: I thought you were going? Bye, jst in case you are.
