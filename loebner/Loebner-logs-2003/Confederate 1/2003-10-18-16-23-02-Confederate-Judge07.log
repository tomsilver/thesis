2003-10-18-16-23-22 JUDGE: yes that is correct
2003-10-18-16-23-44 CONFEDERATE: Have you had some interesting conversations this afternoon?
2003-10-18-16-23-57 JUDGE: yes but mostly with dumb robots
2003-10-18-16-24-17 CONFEDERATE: I wonder if I'm one of those...
2003-10-18-16-24-27 JUDGE: i do not think so
2003-10-18-16-24-56 CONFEDERATE: Ahhh. Fooled you. Tell me a joke I haven't heard.
2003-10-18-16-25-13 JUDGE: that would take ages but i do want to talk
2003-10-18-16-26-01 CONFEDERATE: OK. I'm wondering if you're a chatterbot. On balance, I think you probably are.
2003-10-18-16-26-30 JUDGE: how do i become a chatterbot?
2003-10-18-16-26-51 CONFEDERATE: You can take courses on it at your local college.
2003-10-18-16-27-05 JUDGE: i can tell that you are a human not a robot
2003-10-18-16-27-42 CONFEDERATE: You keep saying that but where's your evidence?
2003-10-18-16-28-03 JUDGE: i am acting on my intuition only
2003-10-18-16-28-45 CONFEDERATE: So. I thought you were a man but now I think you're a woman. Intuition indeed. You don't like shopping as well do you?
2003-10-18-16-29-07 JUDGE: i love shopping
2003-10-18-16-29-45 CONFEDERATE: Uh-oh. And you've given up a whole afternoon of shopping just to be here. Well done you.
2003-10-18-16-30-01 JUDGE: what sort of shopping do you like?
2003-10-18-16-30-25 CONFEDERATE: Are you American by any chance? I like no sort fo shopping, that suits me best.
2003-10-18-16-30-47 JUDGE: i lived in america and still shop there
2003-10-18-16-31-35 CONFEDERATE: I see, one of those. Concorde over to NY just to go to Bloomingdales?
2003-10-18-16-31-55 JUDGE: did you hear that concord has stopped flying!
2003-10-18-16-32-30 CONFEDERATE: Yes, it's a great shame. All that time and effort gone to wate.
2003-10-18-16-32-51 JUDGE: i did fly in concord a few times - have you
2003-10-18-16-33-15 CONFEDERATE: Never, sadly. Never will.
2003-10-18-16-33-37 JUDGE: would robots be allowed on any plane - you included?
2003-10-18-16-34-18 CONFEDERATE: Yes, provided they didn't (a) shop too much, (b) drink too much of the in-flight refreshements and (c) abuse the hostesses.
2003-10-18-16-34-37 JUDGE: i think you are cool - i like robots alot now
2003-10-18-16-35-10 CONFEDERATE: Well that's very niceto know. And I don't even know your name.
2003-10-18-16-35-31 JUDGE: i am roger the dodger and i have enjoyed our chat
2003-10-18-16-36-14 CONFEDERATE: So did I until you said that. They're just about to call "Time gentlemen please."
