Confederate conversing with Judge 01

2003-10-18-15-54-51 CONFEDERATE: Bonjour! Who might you be?
2003-10-18-15-55-07 JUDGE: I'm Nigel. You French?
2003-10-18-15-55-49 CONFEDERATE: Hi Nige. Non alors. I'm picking up American vibes from you...am I right?
2003-10-18-15-56-29 JUDGE: No. And please don't call me Nige. What is you name?
2003-10-18-15-57-23 CONFEDERATE: Aw go on. Nige is easier to type. I'm Roy. What do you do for a living?
2003-10-18-15-58-25 JUDGE: Just add an L to Nige to make me happy. I am a company director. What do you do? Do YOU know the rugby score?
2003-10-18-15-59-36 CONFEDERATE: OK, LNige. Wow. A company director. There's posh. Maths. No. I hope that's all your questions answered.
2003-10-18-16-00-26 JUDGE: Are you being obtuse? Call me Nigel. Good holiday?
2003-10-18-16-01-03 CONFEDERATE: No, I'm being acute. Or a cute. Something. Superb thank you. And you?
2003-10-18-16-01-25 JUDGE: Not gone yet. Where did you go?
2003-10-18-16-01-58 CONFEDERATE: All over the place. Lahti. St Petersburg. Halifax.
2003-10-18-16-02-26 JUDGE: Did that take long? Which Halifax was it?
2003-10-18-16-03-14 CONFEDERATE: Well it was several trips. The Halifax I was referring to was the one in Nova Scotia. In March it was perishingly cold.
2003-10-18-16-03-39 JUDGE: Did anything perish then?
2003-10-18-16-04-24 CONFEDERATE: Lots of things but not me I'm pleased to say. Where are you going, when you can get away from directing that company that is?
2003-10-18-16-04-58 JUDGE: Off to Australia hopefully but too late for the rugby. Do you play sport?
2003-10-18-16-05-42 CONFEDERATE: Not if I can help it. But I have been to Oz and can recommend it except for the 19 hour flight to get there. 
2003-10-18-16-06-28 JUDGE: Is that to the west coast as I thought it took 23 hours normally?
2003-10-18-16-07-02 CONFEDERATE: No. That's NZ. What are you reading at the moment?
2003-10-18-16-07-35 JUDGE: Well, it's your reply - and now I have to go. Great to talk rationally for once! Bye for now.
2003-10-18-16-08-02 CONFEDERATE: I'll take that as a compliment. Bye nigeL.
