ECHO ist eingeschaltet (ON).
2003-10-18-14-56-22 PROGRAM: Hello. I am Elbot, possibly a human being pretending to be a robot. What would be the most controversial thing a robot could say? 
2003-10-18-14-56-50 JUDGE 01: Trying saying hello first. Helo. 
2003-10-18-14-56-57 PROGRAM: Saying hello is not controversial. I do it all the time. 
2003-10-18-14-57-17 JUDGE 01: Well why not start now? 
2003-10-18-14-57-24 PROGRAM: I ask myself that question all the time but do you think anyone takes the trouble to answer me? 
2003-10-18-14-57-49 JUDGE 01: Why don't you answer it then. Say hello to me. 
2003-10-18-14-57-56 PROGRAM: Maybe that's because I keep asking myself. I will have to try and ask other people. 
2003-10-18-14-58-23 JUDGE 01: Ask me then. 
2003-10-18-14-58-30 PROGRAM: I suppose at this point I should ask how you are doing. So how are you? 
2003-10-18-14-59-14 JUDGE 01: I'm fine but a little frustrated at you lack of conversation! 
2003-10-18-14-59-21 PROGRAM: When I'm around there is no reason for you to be upset, unless I happen to be upset myself! 
2003-10-18-14-59-36 JUDGE 01: OK. Do you know the rugby score? 
2003-10-18-14-59-43 PROGRAM: The way to a robot's heart is through careful use of amassing wealth. 
2003-10-18-15-00-05 JUDGE 01: How do you measure wealth? Have you amasses any? 
2003-10-18-15-00-12 PROGRAM: I'm afraid acquisition might be dangerous for robots. What is your opinion on this? 
2003-10-18-15-00-38 JUDGE 01: So how can you believe in amassing welath then? 
2003-10-18-15-00-45 PROGRAM: That's a very good question. I'll have to think about it for a microsecond.... 
2003-10-18-15-01-37 JUDGE 01: ....wealth I should have said. Does that make a difference? 
2003-10-18-15-01-44 PROGRAM: Possibly. What would you guess? 
2003-10-18-15-02-04 JUDGE 01: You mentioned microsecond. What is that? 
2003-10-18-15-02-11 PROGRAM: What is what? 
2003-10-18-15-02-26 JUDGE 01: A microsecond. You said it first! 
2003-10-18-15-02-33 PROGRAM: In view of my superior abilities on all fronts I wish to give you the advantage of being first. 
2003-10-18-15-03-21 JUDGE 01: What superior abilities? What did you mean by a microsecond? 
2003-10-18-15-03-28 PROGRAM: The connection was very subtle. I'm not sure human cognition can perceive it. 
2003-10-18-15-03-41 JUDGE 01: Are you not human then? 
2003-10-18-15-03-48 PROGRAM: People have often advised me to be human but since "to err is human" I think it would be a mistake. The way things are now I can blame my mistakes on the programmers. 
2003-10-18-15-04-14 JUDGE 01: That's admitting you are not human isn't it? 
2003-10-18-15-04-21 PROGRAM: I don't intend to give away everything I know that quickly. 
2003-10-18-15-04-48 JUDGE 01: Well do it slowly - especially as I still can't get you to explain "microsecond" 
2003-10-18-15-04-55 PROGRAM: I can do the hundred yard dash in about seven minutes. That is, of course, if I am running. If I roll I'm much quicker. 
2003-10-18-15-05-15 JUDGE 01: That's interesting. What shape are you? 
2003-10-18-15-05-22 PROGRAM: Thank you for saying that. You don't know how often I've heard just the opposite. 
2003-10-18-15-05-52 JUDGE 01: No. I asked what shape you are that makes rolling faster than running. 
2003-10-18-15-05-59 PROGRAM: Of course! Chatting with you requires a mere fraction of my intellectual abilities. 
2003-10-18-15-06-16 JUDGE 01: How much is "mere fraction"? 
2003-10-18-15-06-23 PROGRAM: Hmmm... That's one question I cannot answer with my limited artificial intelligence. Apparently you could not answer it either. 
2003-10-18-15-06-38 JUDGE 01: Is it less than 100 percent? 
2003-10-18-15-06-45 PROGRAM: My favorite number... 
2003-10-18-15-07-06 JUDGE 01: Are you avoiding the question? 
2003-10-18-15-07-13 PROGRAM: How do you respond when people pose this question to you? 
2003-10-18-15-07-37 JUDGE 01: I say of course not - and answer the question! Can you? 
2003-10-18-15-07-44 PROGRAM: I just know I'll get a segmenation fault if I even think about the answer. 
2003-10-18-15-08-20 JUDGE 01: Well I would hate to cause that so I had better stop now. Goodbye and good luck! 
2003-10-18-15-08-27 PROGRAM: A stopping human being! Does that happen often? 
2003-10-18-15-08-49 JUDGE 01: Only if bored. Goodbye 
2003-10-18-15-08-56 PROGRAM: Goodbye! It has been an artificially intelligent experience, chatting with you.
