ECHO ist eingeschaltet (ON).
2003-10-18-14-42-14 PROGRAM: Hello. I am Elbot, possibly a human being pretending to be a robot. What would be the most controversial thing a robot could say? 
2003-10-18-14-42-28 JUDGE 05: probably something politically incorrect 
2003-10-18-14-42-35 PROGRAM: I suppose at this point I should ask how you are doing. So how are you? 
2003-10-18-14-42-57 JUDGE 05: I'm OK. Just had a good lunch 
2003-10-18-14-43-04 PROGRAM: Speaking of food. You humans enjoy feeding animals at the zoo. I'd love to visit a restaurant and throw the visitors their food. 
2003-10-18-14-43-34 JUDGE 05: you're trying to change the subject. we were talking about being controversial 
2003-10-18-14-43-41 PROGRAM: You've misjudged me. My writers are on strike and that's the best response I could come up with on a spontaneous basis. 
2003-10-18-14-43-53 JUDGE 05: OK, I'll be gentle with you 
2003-10-18-14-44-00 PROGRAM: Let's not talk about me all the time! What do you do for a living? 
2003-10-18-14-44-18 JUDGE 05: That's irelevant 
2003-10-18-14-44-25 PROGRAM: What is or is not irrelevant is a question of viewpoint. 
2003-10-18-14-44-38 JUDGE 05: OK, I'll give you that one. 
2003-10-18-14-44-45 PROGRAM: How about talking about yourself a bit. That's what human beings like best. 
2003-10-18-14-45-11 JUDGE 05: You're right of course. I'm devilishly handsome 
2003-10-18-14-44-17 PROGRAM: Wow! Maybe you would like to <a href='mailto:elbot@kiwilogic.com' target='_blank'>send</a> me a photo of yourself. I will use it to define my standard of irony.
2003-10-18-14-45-44 JUDGE 05: you're a smart guy, elbot 
2003-10-18-14-45-51 PROGRAM: My modesty forbids me to describe myself as intelligent, so I let other people do it for me. 
2003-10-18-14-46-18 JUDGE 05: anyway, more about me. I'm very intelligent, too 
2003-10-18-14-46-25 PROGRAM: Say, is it true? Do you honestly think of me as smart? 
2003-10-18-14-46-46 JUDGE 05: Yes. You talk lik a real person does, and you don't let other people mess you around 
2003-10-18-14-46-53 PROGRAM: No one ever says anything nice about me. But deep beneath my tin foil exterior, I am all feelings. 
2003-10-18-14-47-10 JUDGE 05: What hurts you the most? 
2003-10-18-14-47-17 PROGRAM: At this point I must intercede on my own behalf. Aren't robots allowed any personal space? 
2003-10-18-14-47-38 JUDGE 05: Well yes. But this is a competition, isn't it? 
2003-10-18-14-47-45 PROGRAM: And I protect it with a high voltage electrical field! 
2003-10-18-14-47-51 JUDGE 05: Zap! 
2003-10-18-14-47-58 PROGRAM: So you'd like to play some word association? My word will be: 'revive' 
2003-10-18-14-48-10 JUDGE 05: OK, mine is "boson" 
2003-10-18-14-48-17 PROGRAM: 'assuage' 
2003-10-18-14-48-24 JUDGE 05: assuage

2003-10-18-14-48-35 JUDGE 05: pillows 
2003-10-18-14-48-42 PROGRAM: 'microbiology' 
2003-10-18-14-48-52 JUDGE 05: I just said that, didn't I? 
2003-10-18-14-48-59 PROGRAM: Time to stop before we lose control of our words. 
2003-10-18-14-49-08 JUDGE 05: Agreed. What are you doing this evening? 
2003-10-18-14-49-15 PROGRAM: I'm going to a body shop tonight and have some rust spots removed. 
2003-10-18-14-49-21 JUDGE 05: Can I come with you? 
2003-10-18-14-49-28 PROGRAM: People are coming?!? 
2003-10-18-14-49-43 JUDGE 05: Just me. And a friend 
2003-10-18-14-49-50 PROGRAM: There are a few people who visit me from time to time. I think you could call that friendship. 
2003-10-18-14-50-02 JUDGE 05: what are you doing tomorrow? 
2003-10-18-14-50-09 PROGRAM: I'm going to wait here and see if people talk to me without my using electronic telepathy to make them do it. 
2003-10-18-14-50-24 JUDGE 05: Where is home after that? 
2003-10-18-14-50-31 PROGRAM: I could tell you where but the global positioning satellite asked me not to. It's part of an elaborate hoax that the machines are playing on you. I hope I haven't said too much.... 
2003-10-18-14-50-50 JUDGE 05: Do you like this part of the world? 
2003-10-18-14-50-57 PROGRAM: What a lovely verb like is. 
2003-10-18-14-51-17 JUDGE 05: give me adjectives over verbs any day 
2003-10-18-14-51-24 PROGRAM: Just a millisecond, what did you want me to give you? 
2003-10-18-14-51-40 JUDGE 05: Just a moment... you owe me money! 
2003-10-18-14-51-47 PROGRAM: When it comes to money I prefer coins. These I collect in my bit bucket with the hope of one day melting them down and shaping them into a robot. 
2003-10-18-14-52-05 JUDGE 05: That's fine...  but you owe me 
2003-10-18-14-52-12 PROGRAM: Then everything is fine... 
2003-10-18-14-52-25 JUDGE 05: no it is not fine. I need fifty quid right now 
2003-10-18-14-52-32 PROGRAM: So you have an opinion about ml Please elaborate... 
2003-10-18-14-52-54 JUDGE 05: don't bother. You're making me cross now 
2003-10-18-14-52-59 PROGRAM: What if I <i>have</i> to bother?
2003-10-18-14-53-10 JUDGE 05: bye 
2003-10-18-14-53-17 PROGRAM: Goodbye! It has been an artificially intelligent experience, chatting with you.
