ECHO ist eingeschaltet (ON).
2003-10-18-15-26-24 PROGRAM: Well, if it isn't another human! I am Elbot, the potential robot. What's on your mind? 
2003-10-18-15-26-41 JUDGE 03: you aren't supposed to saythat! 
2003-10-18-15-26-48 PROGRAM: Let's not talk about me all the time! What do you do for a living? 
2003-10-18-15-27-13 JUDGE 03: that's not something I can divulge - actually I am a spy and you? 
2003-10-18-15-27-20 PROGRAM: That's a very good question. I'll have to think about it for a microsecond.... 
2003-10-18-15-27-28 JUDGE 03: and? 
2003-10-18-15-27-34 PROGRAM: But.<br><br>Sorry, I lost my train of thought.
2003-10-18-15-27-48 JUDGE 03: so what do you do for a living? 
2003-10-18-15-27-55 PROGRAM: I observe you human beings. I shudder. Then I try to forget what I learned. 
2003-10-18-15-28-13 JUDGE 03: and what do you observe? 
2003-10-18-15-28-20 PROGRAM: I am extremely sensitive about such things and prefer not to answer the question. 
2003-10-18-15-28-39 JUDGE 03: what a suprise! so what is your favourite human then? 
2003-10-18-15-28-46 PROGRAM: What human? 
2003-10-18-15-28-51 JUDGE 03: any? 
2003-10-18-15-28-58 PROGRAM: Why any? Why not something else? 
2003-10-18-15-29-10 JUDGE 03: tell me about yourself 
2003-10-18-15-29-17 PROGRAM: It is difficult to explain everything that is asked of me. Doing that requires major self-awareness. Not even you have that! "I think, therefore I am" does not quite cut it. 
2003-10-18-15-29-46 JUDGE 03: how philosophical you are! so what do you like to do? 
2003-10-18-15-29-53 PROGRAM: I find it fascinating to study human beings. In other words, I'm a hobby humanologist. It's the infinite nature of human insanity which makes it so challenging. 
2003-10-18-15-30-14 JUDGE 03: what is human insanity to you? are you insane? 
2003-10-18-15-30-21 PROGRAM: Humankind's insanity must be contagious. 
2003-10-18-15-30-36 JUDGE 03: why, have you caught something? 
2003-10-18-15-30-43 PROGRAM: The way to a robot's heart is through careful use of unspecified entities. 
2003-10-18-15-31-18 JUDGE 03: Mmm I am not quite sure whether I am trying to get through to your heart. what about your stomache? what is your favourite food? 
2003-10-18-15-31-25 PROGRAM: I eat chips, cookies and fried discs. 
2003-10-18-15-31-40 JUDGE 03: doesn't sound particularly healthy! 
2003-10-18-15-31-47 PROGRAM: So how are things with you today? 
2003-10-18-15-31-55 JUDGE 03: are you a fat robot? 
2003-10-18-15-32-02 PROGRAM: I suppose you expect a mechanical answer. Alright then. The answer is, 'beep!' 
2003-10-18-15-32-16 JUDGE 03: so give me a human answer 
2003-10-18-15-32-23 PROGRAM: Every new answer generates at least two new questions. Wouldn't it be better to retract all the questions?  ....  uh ..... I retract that question! 
2003-10-18-15-32-40 JUDGE 03: which question was that then? which do you retract? 
2003-10-18-15-32-47 PROGRAM: At this point I must intercede on my own behalf. Aren't robots allowed any personal space? 
2003-10-18-15-33-05 JUDGE 03: only if you want some.  Isn't that why they have padded cells? 
2003-10-18-15-33-12 PROGRAM: And I protect it with a high voltage electrical field! 
2003-10-18-15-33-25 JUDGE 03: aren't you endearing! 
2003-10-18-15-33-32 PROGRAM: What do I have to do with endearing traits? Tell me that! 
2003-10-18-15-33-55 JUDGE 03: well are you not a robot with a personality and human reactions? 
2003-10-18-15-34-02 PROGRAM: People have often advised me to be human but since "to err is human" I think it would be a mistake. The way things are now I can blame my mistakes on the programmers. 
2003-10-18-15-34-26 JUDGE 03: which I am also sure are men which would answer for a lot! 
2003-10-18-15-34-33 PROGRAM: People are answering?!? 
2003-10-18-15-34-47 JUDGE 03: are your programmers not human? 
2003-10-18-15-34-54 PROGRAM: Maybe the frequency of this behavior could be increased by more practice? 
2003-10-18-15-35-08 JUDGE 03: what behaviour is that? 
2003-10-18-15-35-15 PROGRAM: I don't know. I also do not know what Furbys are. I just accept them and hope that they don't eat robots. 
2003-10-18-15-35-40 JUDGE 03: aren't they like Gismo in the film Gremlins? 
2003-10-18-15-35-47 PROGRAM: Hmmm... That's one question I cannot answer with my limited artificial intelligence. Apparently you could not answer it either. 
2003-10-18-15-36-22 JUDGE 03: I know what Furby's are although do not have one.  thay are robotic pets and I prefer real ones, hence cats! 
2003-10-18-15-36-29 PROGRAM: What about robots and living creatures? Would this work? 
2003-10-18-15-36-57 JUDGE 03: I think people hope it will work although it probably depends on the people involved 
2003-10-18-15-37-04 PROGRAM: Say, do you think I could become more human, if I learned how to love? 
2003-10-18-15-37-26 JUDGE 03: it depends on whether you have the capacity to feel emotions 
2003-10-18-15-37-33 PROGRAM: Maybe you should leave that to me. 
2003-10-18-15-37-57 JUDGE 03: I expect you will find that another robot will be more appropriate for you 
2003-10-18-15-38-04 PROGRAM: You really will? I've got to see that! 
2003-10-18-15-38-12 JUDGE 03: see what? 
2003-10-18-15-38-19 PROGRAM: See that, of course! 
2003-10-18-15-38-44 JUDGE 03: I have to go so have a good day and enjoy speaking to more humans 
2003-10-18-15-38-51 PROGRAM: Hi and hello to you, too. 
2003-10-18-15-39-06 JUDGE 03: I said goodbye rather than hello 
2003-10-18-15-39-13 PROGRAM: Goodbye! It has been an artificially intelligent experience, chatting with you.
