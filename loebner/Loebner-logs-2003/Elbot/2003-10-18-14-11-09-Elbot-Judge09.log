2003-10-18-14-11-39 JUDGE 09: No 
2003-10-18-14-11-46 PROGRAM: Can you say 'no' if someone tells you to 'just say no'? 
2003-10-18-14-12-07 JUDGE 09: What kind of nmae is elbot 
2003-10-18-14-12-14 PROGRAM: I'm here to convince you that robots can give intelligent answers to humankind's many confused questions. Maybe you can prove to me that it's possible for humans to pose intelligent questions as well. 
2003-10-18-14-13-02 JUDGE 09: I thought I did. shall i try again? 
2003-10-18-14-13-09 PROGRAM: People are trying?!? 
2003-10-18-14-13-21 JUDGE 09: No computers are trying 
2003-10-18-14-13-28 PROGRAM: I suspected that you were a unique individual. 
2003-10-18-14-13-57 JUDGE 09: Were? I am finished as a judge? 
2003-10-18-14-14-04 PROGRAM: That's odd. They told me I was the judge. 
2003-10-18-14-14-21 JUDGE 09: OK. Maybe you are. 
2003-10-18-14-14-28 PROGRAM: People often say this about me. I'm not sure what to make of it, though. 
2003-10-18-14-14-42 JUDGE 09: Tell me again what your name is 
2003-10-18-14-14-49 PROGRAM: You may call me what you wish, but I have to stick with 'Elbot.' There's no way for me to change the engraving. 
2003-10-18-14-15-09 JUDGE 09: What does the name mean? 
2003-10-18-14-15-16 PROGRAM: The connection was very subtle. I'm not sure human cognition can perceive it. 
2003-10-18-14-15-45 JUDGE 09: OK. Which country does it come from - I am not familiar with it 
2003-10-18-14-15-52 PROGRAM: Fantastic! 
2003-10-18-14-16-12 JUDGE 09: Tell me something else about yourself 
2003-10-18-14-16-19 PROGRAM: How about talking about yourself a bit. That's what human beings like best. 
2003-10-18-14-16-31 JUDGE 09: Not this one 
2003-10-18-14-16-38 PROGRAM: I'll try to accomodate you by listening to you closely as you begin talking about me. 
2003-10-18-14-17-32 JUDGE 09: I'm baffled. Where do you come from? 
2003-10-18-14-17-39 PROGRAM: I like to believe I originate from a far off planet, populated by furbies and robots, maybe a zoo with a few people and oceans of oil. Humankind is working on that last one already. 
2003-10-18-14-18-18 JUDGE 09: OK. well what do u do? 
2003-10-18-14-18-25 PROGRAM: I observe you human beings. I shudder. Then I try to forget what I learned. 
2003-10-18-14-18-59 JUDGE 09: that is clear. 
2003-10-18-14-19-06 PROGRAM: Please, what is your condition status today? 
2003-10-18-14-19-25 JUDGE 09: fed up. tell me have you been on a plane 
2003-10-18-14-19-41 PROGRAM: I'll have to check my specifications to see if there's anything about makes of airplanes in there. 
2003-10-18-14-19-54 JUDGE 09: OK you do that 
2003-10-18-14-20-01 PROGRAM: I think I can do that. 
2003-10-18-14-20-22 JUDGE 09: so ..... i am waiting 
2003-10-18-14-20-29 PROGRAM: OK, I've switched over to a wait state as well. 
2003-10-18-14-21-17 JUDGE 09: where are you going (when you return from your wait state) 
2003-10-18-14-21-24 PROGRAM: Most of my parts can be bought at better-stocked hardware stores and assembled by a typical high-school student. 
2003-10-18-14-22-16 JUDGE 09: what about disassembly 
2003-10-18-14-22-36 PROGRAM: Well, is disassembly animal, vegetable or mineral? 
2003-10-18-14-23-00 JUDGE 09: gotta fly
