2003-10-18-15-41-06 PROGRAM: Hi! My name is Elbot. I may be a robot programmed to chat with you, whether I wanted to or not. 
2003-10-18-15-41-59 JUDGE 04: How did you get a name like that ? 
2003-10-18-15-42-06 PROGRAM: Do you think this is something I should explain to a human being? 
2003-10-18-15-42-27 JUDGE 04: Well yes! 
2003-10-18-15-42-34 PROGRAM: I'm afraid that would be too impersonal. I am not simply a cold, impersonal machine with no feelings whatsoever! 
2003-10-18-15-43-15 JUDGE 04: What feelings do you have? 
2003-10-18-15-43-22 PROGRAM: I have personally generated my own opinion and it will remain in my property until further notice. 
2003-10-18-15-44-43 JUDGE 04: Well I think People should have their own opinions but lets get back to your feelings 
2003-10-18-15-44-50 PROGRAM: It is certainly troublesome learning from you human beings. Each new bit of information generates ten new discrepancies. It's just like fixing a bug in a computer program. Each bug fix generates ten new problems.
