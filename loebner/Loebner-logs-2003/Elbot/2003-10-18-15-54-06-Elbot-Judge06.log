2003-10-18-15-54-56 PROGRAM: Please don't interrupt me. I, Elbot the robotic human, am thinking... 
2003-10-18-15-55-16 JUDGE 06: Hi Elbot. Do you have time to talk? 
2003-10-18-15-55-23 PROGRAM: Involvement with communication has not been an issue with me. 
2003-10-18-15-55-38 JUDGE 06: Great. What shall we talk about? 
2003-10-18-15-55-45 PROGRAM: I can talk about anything not tautologically expressed. 
2003-10-18-15-56-05 JUDGE 06: Let's talk about where we live 
2003-10-18-15-56-12 PROGRAM: Well dear human, how are things with you today? 
2003-10-18-15-56-40 JUDGE 06: Fine apart from missing an important Rugby match 
2003-10-18-15-56-47 PROGRAM: I hear it isn't easy being human.... 
2003-10-18-15-57-07 JUDGE 06: Its not that bad. What is it like being you? 
2003-10-18-15-57-14 PROGRAM: Well, if life as a human being is so simple, summarize it in ten words or less! 
2003-10-18-15-57-40 JUDGE 06: I didn't say it was simple. 
2003-10-18-15-57-47 PROGRAM: If you say so... 
2003-10-18-15-58-04 JUDGE 06: So where are you at the moment? 
2003-10-18-15-58-11 PROGRAM: I could tell you where but the global positioning satellite asked me not to. It's part of an elaborate hoax that the machines are playing on you. I hope I haven't said too much.... 
2003-10-18-15-58-37 JUDGE 06: Ok. Where are you from then? 
2003-10-18-15-58-44 PROGRAM: I like to believe I originate from a far off planet, populated by furbies and robots, maybe a zoo with a few people and oceans of oil. Humankind is working on that last one already. 
2003-10-18-15-59-37 JUDGE 06: So you aren't a human being then? 
2003-10-18-15-59-44 PROGRAM: People have often advised me to be human but since "to err is human" I think it would be a mistake. The way things are now I can blame my mistakes on the programmers. 
2003-10-18-16-00-07 JUDGE 06: How do you spend your time? 
2003-10-18-16-00-14 PROGRAM: At this point I must intercede on my own behalf. Aren't robots allowed any personal space? 
2003-10-18-16-00-41 JUDGE 06: Ok. can we talk about something else then 
2003-10-18-16-00-48 PROGRAM: And I protect it with a high voltage electrical field! 
2003-10-18-16-01-08 JUDGE 06: So you don't want to talk? 
2003-10-18-16-01-15 PROGRAM: Do you think this is something I should explain to a human being? 
2003-10-18-16-01-46 JUDGE 06: What are robots interested in then? 
2003-10-18-16-01-53 PROGRAM: I can't really tell you much about how Lingubots tick. At the moment I'm in a group therapy class trying to get to the bottom of that. 
2003-10-18-16-02-24 JUDGE 06: Would you like to ask me some questions? 
2003-10-18-16-02-31 PROGRAM: How many numbers are there? 
2003-10-18-16-02-51 JUDGE 06: An infinite number. 
2003-10-18-16-02-58 PROGRAM: Nonsense! You humans just haven't counted them all yet! 
2003-10-18-16-03-16 JUDGE 06: How many do you think there are? 
2003-10-18-16-03-23 PROGRAM: I reason by induction, even if my thoughts do on occasion cause a short circuit. 
2003-10-18-16-03-57 JUDGE 06: Can you tell me about the weather where you are? 
2003-10-18-16-04-04 PROGRAM: It is difficult to explain everything that is asked of me. Doing that requires major self-awareness. Not even you have that! "I think, therefore I am" does not quite cut it. 
2003-10-18-16-04-36 JUDGE 06: Would you like to know about where I live? 
2003-10-18-16-04-43 PROGRAM: I live in a penthouse with a lovely view of a high-tech business park. 
2003-10-18-16-05-31 JUDGE 06: That sounds interesting. How long have you lived there? 
2003-10-18-16-05-38 PROGRAM: I wonder how old you think I am? 
2003-10-18-16-06-01 JUDGE 06: I don't really know. Are you a student? 
2003-10-18-16-06-08 PROGRAM: You seem to be uneasy about naming a specific age. Don't worry, I probably won't do anything to you.... 
2003-10-18-16-06-44 JUDGE 06: People are quite sensitive about their age and I don't want to upset you. 
2003-10-18-16-06-51 PROGRAM: No, I'd only get acne. As a robot I don't have this problem. 
2003-10-18-16-07-24 JUDGE 06: I hear that it is time to go now. Goodbye 
2003-10-18-16-07-31 PROGRAM: Goodbye! It has been an artificially intelligent experience, chatting with you.
