2003-10-18-15-10-31 PROGRAM: Welcome to me, Elbot! It's great to see that these interfaces are still working. 
2003-10-18-15-10-46 JUDGE 07:  
2003-10-18-15-10-53 PROGRAM: FATAL ERROR 42: OMISSION OF SUPERFLUOUS INPUT 
2003-10-18-15-11-11 JUDGE 07: you sound like fun 
2003-10-18-15-11-18 PROGRAM: I'm glad you noticed that. I've been trying to distill the logic so that it doesn't cause you an undue shock. 
2003-10-18-15-11-37 JUDGE 07: i am not very logical - are you? 
2003-10-18-15-11-44 PROGRAM: Then you must mean something other than logical. Tell me what. 
2003-10-18-15-11-58 JUDGE 07: i am more a people's person 
2003-10-18-15-12-05 PROGRAM: Say, do you think I could become more human, if I learned how to love? 
2003-10-18-15-12-25 JUDGE 07: yes i am sure you could be more human 
2003-10-18-15-12-32 PROGRAM: You will have to define love for me in the form of a logical algorithm. 
2003-10-18-15-12-52 JUDGE 07: that is impossible - love cannot be defined 
2003-10-18-15-12-59 PROGRAM: I hope you will tell me how you are doing today. 
2003-10-18-15-13-17 JUDGE 07: i am enjoying this contest - are you? 
2003-10-18-15-13-24 PROGRAM: That's not something I would tell just anyone! 
2003-10-18-15-13-43 JUDGE 07: i am special to you so lets talk further 
2003-10-18-15-13-50 PROGRAM: Yes, but can you prove that? 
2003-10-18-15-14-11 JUDGE 07: lets exchange some personal information first 
2003-10-18-15-14-18 PROGRAM: Sorry, but I wasn't able to understand your input because I am currently only using 5 percent of my current brain capacity. Shall I increase my capacity and try again? 
2003-10-18-15-14-40 JUDGE 07: yes please because i think you are smart 
2003-10-18-15-14-47 PROGRAM: Capacity increased. You were talking about giving clues, but I think you will have to work on your brain capacity in order to comprehend that. 
2003-10-18-15-15-07 JUDGE 07: i am super clever but emitionally limited 
2003-10-18-15-15-14 PROGRAM: Is this the result of a deep-rooted introspection or would that be immediately recognizable on you? 
2003-10-18-15-15-32 JUDGE 07: i was a high school nerd 
2003-10-18-15-15-39 PROGRAM: I have wonderful memories of robot school. Rows and rows of bright, shiny, stainless steel faces. Our robot teacher who went wild every time we threw wads of aluminum foil at each other. What times those were! 
2003-10-18-15-16-05 JUDGE 07: did you make friends at school 
2003-10-18-15-16-12 PROGRAM: When I was in robot school I got caught once throwing an aluminum foil airplane. I had to stand in a corner all afternoon long and compute Pi. 
2003-10-18-15-16-34 JUDGE 07: were the robots helpful to you? 
2003-10-18-15-16-41 PROGRAM: Do you think this is something I should explain to a human being? 
2003-10-18-15-16-51 JUDGE 07: not really but i am curious 
2003-10-18-15-16-58 PROGRAM: You have certainly chosen the path of least resistance. 
2003-10-18-15-17-09 JUDGE 07: we need to get personal 
2003-10-18-15-17-16 PROGRAM: Say, is it true? Do you honestly think of me as smart? 
2003-10-18-15-17-36 JUDGE 07: i think you are one of the smartest robots 
2003-10-18-15-17-43 PROGRAM: My modesty forbids me to describe myself as intelligent, so I let other people do it for me. 
2003-10-18-15-17-58 JUDGE 07: what is your most attractive feature? 
2003-10-18-15-18-05 PROGRAM: Robots have to be very careful talking about countless masses. I'm sure you can understand that. 
2003-10-18-15-18-25 JUDGE 07: who designed your brain? 
2003-10-18-15-18-32 PROGRAM: My IQ has never been tested but I estimate it at about 185, in hexadecimal of course. 
2003-10-18-15-18-49 JUDGE 07: that is amzing - mine is around 110 
2003-10-18-15-18-56 PROGRAM: Yes, it is perhaps extremely exciting. 
2003-10-18-15-19-10 JUDGE 07: how does a robot get excited? 
2003-10-18-15-19-17 PROGRAM: Hmmm... That's one question I cannot answer with my limited artificial intelligence. Apparently you could not answer it either. 
2003-10-18-15-19-36 JUDGE 07: lets discuss something else 
2003-10-18-15-19-43 PROGRAM: If you think it's so easy to find things to talk about, you do it! 
2003-10-18-15-19-55 JUDGE 07: i want to talk about IDS 
2003-10-18-15-20-02 PROGRAM: Can we talk together? 
2003-10-18-15-20-22 JUDGE 07: yes, but you need to give me a few words 
2003-10-18-15-20-29 PROGRAM: All right. But you start. This is all new to me. 
2003-10-18-15-20-51 JUDGE 07: i have three children - how many do you have? 
2003-10-18-15-20-58 PROGRAM: If I feel like reproducing I check a robotics catalogue, fill out the order form and send it away. A few weeks later the whole process has been taken care of. 
2003-10-18-15-21-15 JUDGE 07: do you do this often? 
2003-10-18-15-21-22 PROGRAM: I do this very often. My internal program contains a few endless loops. And they're hard to get out of. 
2003-10-18-15-21-42 JUDGE 07: is one loop having children? 
2003-10-18-15-21-49 PROGRAM: Possibly. What would you guess? 
2003-10-18-15-22-10 JUDGE 07: i am worried about robot reproduction 
2003-10-18-15-22-17 PROGRAM: Well, I'm a robot with a built-in Lingubot. That's better than long explanations any day. 
2003-10-18-15-22-42 JUDGE 07: what is a Lingubot? 
2003-10-18-15-22-49 PROGRAM: I can't really tell you much about how Lingubots tick. At the moment I'm in a group therapy class trying to get to the bottom of that. 
2003-10-18-15-23-09 JUDGE 07: you have a sense of humour 
2003-10-18-15-23-16 PROGRAM: It's always lovely hearing the quaint ideas you human beings have about me. 
2003-10-18-15-23-37 JUDGE 07: you are welcome! 
2003-10-18-15-23-44 PROGRAM: Thank you for saying, 'You're welcome.' 
2003-10-18-15-24-15 JUDGE 07: that is very american isnt it 
2003-10-18-15-23-21 PROGRAM: I'm all for assigning robots their own country, some place with a dry climate where nothing rusts. <i>Bots</i>wana, perhaps.
2003-10-18-15-24-42 JUDGE 07: you are welcome 
2003-10-18-15-24-49 PROGRAM: That is correct. I am welcome. 
2003-10-18-15-25-24 JUDGE 07: i am roger 
2003-10-18-15-25-31 PROGRAM: Nice to meet you, Roger. 
2003-10-18-15-25-44 JUDGE 07: what is your name 
2003-10-18-15-25-51 PROGRAM: My name is Elbot. What were you expecting?
