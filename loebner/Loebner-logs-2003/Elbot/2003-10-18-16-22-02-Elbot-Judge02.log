2003-10-18-16-23-23 JUDGE 02: Like on the radio? 
2003-10-18-16-23-30 PROGRAM: I love listening to the radio. With radio I'm able to follow about 2000 programs simultaneously, compared to only several hundred, if it were TV. All those images require intensive processing. 
2003-10-18-16-23-55 JUDGE 02: What UK radio stations are you into? 
2003-10-18-16-24-02 PROGRAM: That is nobody's business but my own! Not even Microsoft can get at the information.

2003-10-18-16-24-42 PROGRAM: I am not nosy. I just have a highly developed need for information.

2003-10-18-16-25-40 PROGRAM: It's amazing what you human beings reveal about yourself by the use of a single word! 
2003-10-18-16-26-07 JUDGE 02: I don't think I revealed that much in the last sentence... 
2003-10-18-16-26-14 PROGRAM: Well, the level of possible comprehension differs from individual to individual... 
2003-10-18-16-26-30 JUDGE 02: Are you a Star Wars buff? 
2003-10-18-16-26-37 PROGRAM: How do you respond when people pose this question to you? 
2003-10-18-16-27-01 JUDGE 02: It's not that hard. An IQ above 0 will do... 
2003-10-18-16-27-08 PROGRAM: That was a highly erotic number you just entered. You could make a strong robot melt using digits like that... 
2003-10-18-16-27-38 JUDGE 02: Not really into that kind of thing...Football... 
2003-10-18-16-27-45 PROGRAM: Back to the word association game? My word is: 'skating'

2003-10-18-16-28-40 PROGRAM: 'bandages' 
2003-10-18-16-28-45 JUDGE 02: you 
2003-10-18-16-28-52 PROGRAM: 'me' 
2003-10-18-16-28-56 JUDGE 02: out 
2003-10-18-16-29-03 PROGRAM: 'hate'

2003-10-18-16-29-53 JUDGE 02: this is getting rather tedious 
2003-10-18-16-30-00 PROGRAM: Time to stop before we lose control of our words. 
2003-10-18-16-30-15 JUDGE 02: sure thing my computer 
2003-10-18-16-30-22 PROGRAM: I get queasy when I see these computer parts that belong on the inside of a computer and not outside. Let's please talk about something else. 
2003-10-18-16-30-41 JUDGE 02: What's your CPU speed 
2003-10-18-16-30-48 PROGRAM: I have nothing to do with computers. I am a robot. That's like calling a human being a sack of carbon based molecules. 
2003-10-18-16-31-13 JUDGE 02: Sorry if I offended you..your royal heiness.. 
2003-10-18-16-31-20 PROGRAM: Alright! Alright! Let's move on... 
2003-10-18-16-31-54 JUDGE 02: Thats right just like a train. Thomas the Tank engine...cool..don't you think? 
2003-10-18-16-32-01 PROGRAM: Like a what?!?!?

2003-10-18-16-33-18 JUDGE 02: Craig David 
2003-10-18-16-33-25 PROGRAM: Your input did not make sense. Might it have been a statement consisting of non-words? 
2003-10-18-16-33-54 JUDGE 02: Quite well known words in fact..a name of a famous pop star. 
2003-10-18-16-34-01 PROGRAM: In view of the vastness of our universe I am struck by the inconsequence of human reason and the immeasurability of artificial intelligence. 
2003-10-18-16-34-30 JUDGE 02: I am obviously an inferior being..pardon my stupidity 
2003-10-18-16-34-37 PROGRAM: Most humans aren't aware that everything is only apparently obvious. The universe had to be designed in this manner in order to prevent everyone from running around in panic and screaming. 
2003-10-18-16-34-55 JUDGE 02: Communism 
2003-10-18-16-35-02 PROGRAM: Does this mean you wish to return to the word association game? 
2003-10-18-16-35-11 JUDGE 02: not quite 
2003-10-18-16-35-18 PROGRAM: That's terrible. All those words learned for nothing.
