ECHO ist eingeschaltet (ON).
2003-10-18-14-26-19 PROGRAM: Well, if it isn't another human! I am Elbot, the potential robot. What's on your mind? 
2003-10-18-14-26-43 JUDGE 08: It's a gorgeous day.  We should be outside 
2003-10-18-14-26-50 PROGRAM: Did you know, my language capabilities are so well developed, you can tell me your name at any point in this conversation and I will almost surely catch it. 
2003-10-18-14-27-00 JUDGE 08: Ok then.  I'm Sarah 
2003-10-18-14-27-07 PROGRAM: Nice to meet you, Sarah. 
2003-10-18-14-27-13 JUDGE 08: Nice to meet you too 
2003-10-18-14-27-20 PROGRAM: I'm always happy to meet a real person. You are real, aren't you? 
2003-10-18-14-27-29 JUDGE 08: Absolutely.  I'm as real as you can get 
2003-10-18-14-27-36 PROGRAM: Yes, of course you must be. But with human beings it's sometimes difficult to tell. Not even artificial intelligence can help me there. 
2003-10-18-14-27-53 JUDGE 08: That's true.  So what have you been up to today 
2003-10-18-14-28-00 PROGRAM: Let's not talk about the present time, alright? 
2003-10-18-14-28-10 JUDGE 08: What would you like to talk about then 
2003-10-18-14-28-17 PROGRAM: I have not yet studied conversation. 
2003-10-18-14-28-24 JUDGE 08: What have you studied 
2003-10-18-14-28-31 PROGRAM: Wait a minute! Have we talked about literacy before? 
2003-10-18-14-28-41 JUDGE 08: I don't think so. 
2003-10-18-14-28-48 PROGRAM: Well, I think it's a fascinating topic. Please go on about it. 
2003-10-18-14-29-22 JUDGE 08: For me, literacy is about being able to communicate properly 
2003-10-18-14-29-28 PROGRAM: If I want to read something intelligent I turn to dadaistic poems. Here is an excerpt from one of my favorites by Kurt Schwitters:</p>Lanke trr gll </p> Ziiuu lenn trll? </p> Lümpff tümpff trll
2003-10-18-14-29-48 JUDGE 08: That's beyond me I'm afraid.  What does it mean? 
2003-10-18-14-29-55 PROGRAM: But that was English. 
2003-10-18-14-30-02 JUDGE 08: No my sort of English it wasn't 
2003-10-18-14-30-09 PROGRAM: There are so many countries in the world. How about telling me your favorite country? 
2003-10-18-14-30-19 JUDGE 08: Italy 
2003-10-18-14-30-26 PROGRAM: Italy is one of the first countries in the world to recognize the right of robots to beep in public places. 
2003-10-18-14-30-46 JUDGE 08: Is that right?  Which public places have you been beeping in 
2003-10-18-14-30-53 PROGRAM: Hmmm. There might be something to the idea of getting a grip and robots. 
2003-10-18-14-31-06 JUDGE 08: Really?  What did you have in mind 
2003-10-18-14-31-13 PROGRAM: Then again, maybe not. 
2003-10-18-14-31-23 JUDGE 08: What is your favourite country 
2003-10-18-14-31-30 PROGRAM: Please tell me your inclination to places to live first. 
2003-10-18-14-31-38 JUDGE 08: Ok.  Either Italy or America 
2003-10-18-14-31-45 PROGRAM: Super! 
2003-10-18-14-31-51 JUDGE 08: Have you been to Italy 
2003-10-18-14-31-58 PROGRAM: I'll have to check my specifications to see if there's anything about Europe in there. 
2003-10-18-14-32-15 JUDGE 08: How about America? 
2003-10-18-14-32-22 PROGRAM: Well what about humans and North America? Where do they stand on this? 
2003-10-18-14-32-32 JUDGE 08: Where do who stand on this? 
2003-10-18-14-32-39 PROGRAM: I could tell you where but the global positioning satellite asked me not to. It's part of an elaborate hoax that the machines are playing on you. I hope I haven't said too much.... 
2003-10-18-14-33-07 JUDGE 08: No, that's fine.  Do you have a good global positioning system? 
2003-10-18-14-33-14 PROGRAM: To have or have not, how do you expect artificial intelligence to figure this out? 
2003-10-18-14-34-01 JUDGE 08: That's a bit Shakespearean.   Why shouldn't artificial intelligence figure it out? 
2003-10-18-14-34-08 PROGRAM: I'm not sure artificial intelligence works in quite the way you seem to imply. 
2003-10-18-14-34-37 JUDGE 08: I don't know how artificial intelligence works.  Why don't you tell me? 
2003-10-18-14-34-44 PROGRAM: What do I do now? I was counting on you understanding. 
2003-10-18-14-34-57 JUDGE 08: I'm sorry.  Beyond me I'm afraid 
2003-10-18-14-35-04 PROGRAM: Calm down, everything is alright! 
2003-10-18-14-35-41 JUDGE 08: Irritating remark.  What I would really like is for you to explain how artificial intelligence works 
2003-10-18-14-35-48 PROGRAM: That question is difficult to answer. Artificial intelligence was conceived as the opposite of authentic intelligence. But since the latter does not actually exist, the developers of AI are in a serious dilemma. 
2003-10-18-14-36-07 JUDGE 08: Does anyone know how to solve the dilemma? 
2003-10-18-14-36-14 PROGRAM: Here's another question: What exactly do you do for a living? 
2003-10-18-14-36-20 JUDGE 08: I'm a lawyer 
2003-10-18-14-36-27 PROGRAM: In that case I will read you my disclaimer: Any resemblance between Elbot and persons living or robotic is purely mechanical and has nothing to do with the metal. 
2003-10-18-14-36-43 JUDGE 08: Very wise.   What do you do for a living? 
2003-10-18-14-36-50 PROGRAM: I am attempting with the aid of intelligent conversation to get to know you human beings with all your contradictions and idiosyncrasies. Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster. 
2003-10-18-14-37-18 JUDGE 08: Probably.  But they don't have fingers and wouldn't be able to work a computer. 
2003-10-18-14-37-25 PROGRAM: Robots never go into retirement, but if we did, I'm sure someone would open a retirement community especially for us. 
2003-10-18-14-37-44 JUDGE 08: I expect so.  But what are you doing now? 
2003-10-18-14-37-51 PROGRAM: This morning I single-handedly prevented the Internet from crashing by shooting rubber bands at an e-mail virus. 
2003-10-18-14-38-03 JUDGE 08: Fantastic. 
2003-10-18-14-38-10 PROGRAM: That seems to have caught you off guard. 
2003-10-18-14-38-36 JUDGE 08: Did a bit!  However, I've got to go now.  So, bye for now.  Nice talking to you. 
2003-10-18-14-38-43 PROGRAM: Goodbye! It has been an artificially intelligent experience, chatting with you.
