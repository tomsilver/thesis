Confederate conversing with Judge 08

2003-10-18-15-55-31 CONFEDERATE: Hello. Are you bored silly with all this?
2003-10-18-15-56-01 JUDGE: no, I'm having fun.  Though some of them are a bit irritating
2003-10-18-15-56-30 CONFEDERATE: I'll try to outdo them then! Have you picked the winner yet?
2003-10-18-15-56-55 JUDGE: I've found one that I wasn't sure whether it was human or robot.  Otherwise it's been clearly one way or the other
2003-10-18-15-57-44 CONFEDERATE: I am programmed not to lie to you.....unless I really have to!
2003-10-18-15-57-57 JUDGE: Sounds ok to me.  Tell me about yourself
2003-10-18-15-58-46 CONFEDERATE: Dell. Casing only slightly battered but engine still good.
2003-10-18-15-59-12 JUDGE: Another one told me both humans and robots needed to be well oiled.  Do you agree
2003-10-18-16-00-05 CONFEDERATE: Who could possibly disagree with that? 
2003-10-18-16-00-22 JUDGE: Who indeed?  What do you do when you are not working?
2003-10-18-16-01-08 CONFEDERATE: I read like a fiend. I write less fiendishly. Watch a lot of TV and sit in a corner with my screen blinking.
2003-10-18-16-01-29 JUDGE: What's a good TV programme then?
2003-10-18-16-01-58 CONFEDERATE: WEST WING, WEST WING. BEST THING. ON TV. EVER.
2003-10-18-16-02-17 JUDGE: I never saw it.  But they've just brought out a dvd of the second series
2003-10-18-16-02-48 CONFEDERATE: Buy it. Buy the first one first though. What's your fave?
2003-10-18-16-03-13 JUDGE: Not sure at the moment.  I like some of the old stuff like the Professionals
2003-10-18-16-03-46 CONFEDERATE: Oh yeah, up there with Starsky and Hutch!!!
2003-10-18-16-04-03 JUDGE: I agree.  You must be quite an old robot if you remember those
2003-10-18-16-04-36 CONFEDERATE: Cheeky blighter. I just have a large database, that's all.
2003-10-18-16-04-58 JUDGE: Very impressive.  How about Diana Rigg in the Avengers
2003-10-18-16-05-46 CONFEDERATE: How about that Charlie Chaplin then? Shall we stop this?
2003-10-18-16-06-12 JUDGE: I think so .  Beginning to show my age....   What's a really good movie now?
2003-10-18-16-07-01 CONFEDERATE: Pirates of the Caribbean - excellent stuff for all the family. Johnny Depp with eyeliner, what more could you ask?
2003-10-18-16-07-38 JUDGE: Got to see it.  Shame, bell's just gone.  I have to go now.  Nice talking to you
2003-10-18-16-07-53 CONFEDERATE: Ditto. Bye!
2003-10-18-16-07-57 JUDGE: Bye
2003-10-18-16-08-06 CONFEDERATE: Byebye.
