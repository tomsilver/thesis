2003-10-18-14-43-13 JUDGE: No. I am just into my urban culture. Graffiti, djing and biking.

2003-10-18-14-49-28 CONFEDERATE: I think there's huge amoun ts we don't know, won't ever know and probably wouldnn't want to know. The world is better off without SH in power but there was no kind of end plan..

2003-10-18-14-53-19 JUDGE: Waiting in casualty to get a head injury seen to. Was a bit of a heavy night out...Have you had any similar experiences.
2003-10-18-14-53-50 CONFEDERATE: Not as dramatic as that. You're obviously male.
2003-10-18-14-54-24 JUDGE: Been really good having a chat...I am..Big your massive and crew...
2003-10-18-14-54-43 CONFEDERATE: What on earth is that?
