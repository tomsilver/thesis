2003-10-18-14-27-04 JUDGE: I'm Chris
2003-10-18-14-27-24 CONFEDERATE: I'm Abigail
2003-10-18-14-27-38 JUDGE: that's a nice name. What does it mean?
2003-10-18-14-27-54 CONFEDERATE: I think it means 'handmaiden'
2003-10-18-14-28-08 JUDGE: do you know what CHris means?
2003-10-18-14-28-24 CONFEDERATE: Is that Christopher or Christine?
2003-10-18-14-28-41 JUDGE: Christopher. It means "Christ carrier".
2003-10-18-14-29-02 CONFEDERATE: Of course, St Chrispher carrying Baby Jesus across flooded river!
2003-10-18-14-29-40 JUDGE: That's the one. DO you live near here?
2003-10-18-14-30-03 CONFEDERATE: Yes. Godalming.
2003-10-18-14-30-36 JUDGE: I used to live down here, but I've moved up the the Midlands now
2003-10-18-14-31-22 CONFEDERATE: I like the Midlands. Especially Birmingham. Except the NEC of course...
2003-10-18-14-31-45 JUDGE: The NEC's almost as bad as Wembley - and that's saying something
2003-10-18-14-32-19 CONFEDERATE: Where in the whole wide world would you like to live if money was no object?
2003-10-18-14-33-11 JUDGE: Erm...  I really like England, but maybe somewhere in Scandinavia. Or New York.
2003-10-18-14-33-49 CONFEDERATE: That's a big difference.
2003-10-18-14-34-07 JUDGE: sorry...  i just got cut off. Where would you like to live?
2003-10-18-14-35-05 CONFEDERATE: A waiter in a restaurant yesterday showed me a brochure about Ischia. I think Ischia would be the place...
2003-10-18-14-35-17 JUDGE: Is that Greece?
2003-10-18-14-35-59 CONFEDERATE: No, I think it's off the coast of Italy. It's a thermal spa, so I bet it's not far from Naples and Vesuvius.
2003-10-18-14-36-27 JUDGE: Wouldn't yet get kind of tense waiting for Vesuvius to blow up every few years?
2003-10-18-14-36-42 CONFEDERATE: Hee heee
2003-10-18-14-37-05 JUDGE: But you're right - Italy is beautiful. You speaka da language?
2003-10-18-14-37-39 CONFEDERATE: Only in restaurants. I do so luuuurrrvve Italian food.
2003-10-18-14-38-17 JUDGE: I love cooking it. lots of grilled peppers, lots of oil, parmesan. that kind of stuff
2003-10-18-14-39-08 CONFEDERATE: Yes, the vegetables are the best. They do eat a lot of veal though, which is not so good. The Bambi factor you know.
2003-10-18-14-39-56 JUDGE: Oh dear the bell's gone. I don't know many robots who love Italian food but I'll have to say goodbye
2003-10-18-14-40-16 CONFEDERATE: What a shame. Byebye.
2003-10-18-14-40-34 JUDGE: it was really nice talking to you. see you on the other side, Abigail from Godalming
2003-10-18-14-40-57 CONFEDERATE: On the other side it is, then. Bye!
