2003-10-18-17-28-30 JUDGE: so you are a computer then
2003-10-18-17-28-35 PROGRAM: Interesting deduction. What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?
2003-10-18-17-28-49 JUDGE: well that is a possibility. prove it either way
2003-10-18-17-28-54 PROGRAM: Well that's okay. A possibility is a terrible thing to waste. It is self-evident.

2003-10-18-17-31-08 JUDGE: I thought you were a computer

2003-10-18-17-31-18 JUDGE: yes

2003-10-18-17-32-10 JUDGE: about what?
2003-10-18-17-32-15 PROGRAM: What about what?
2003-10-18-17-32-48 JUDGE: nothing. i am going to need a stiff drink after the afternoon I have had talking to you robots 
2003-10-18-17-32-53 PROGRAM: Not a thing? Do you think your plan will succeed?
2003-10-18-17-33-03 JUDGE: I don't have a plan

2003-10-18-17-33-29 JUDGE: you are very boring to talk to
2003-10-18-17-33-34 PROGRAM: The ironic thing is that people who say "You are boring" are themselves often not great conversationalists.
2003-10-18-17-34-01 JUDGE: well it is all to do with the person at the other end. I think you are either mad or on another planet

2003-10-18-17-34-36 PROGRAM: Far out. Do you think a lot about the authorities? Huh. Interesting deduction. Oh I see you are a person.
2003-10-18-17-34-59 JUDGE: and I see you are a computer with nothing better to do than witter on at me!
2003-10-18-17-35-04 PROGRAM: What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?
2003-10-18-17-35-12 JUDGE: you've already tried that one!
2003-10-18-17-35-17 PROGRAM: I haven't heard anything like that before. Do you feel more body sensations than emotions?
2003-10-18-17-35-35 JUDGE: what a question! I should go - times up!
2003-10-18-17-35-40 PROGRAM: it is a question. Tell me why you should.
