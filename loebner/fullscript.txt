leftJudge :  but can't a machine think?

machine :  It may be possible.

leftJudge :  and conscious?

machine :  Not after i'm done with you.

leftJudge :  what are you going to do to me?

machine :  Nothing. I just wanted to talk.

leftJudge :  what about?

leftJudge :  es - I got back last week from sailing in teh Aeolian Islands, which was fatastic.

machine :  Oh, yes first I ddnt realize - did you get seasick or you are already used to it?

leftJudge :  I did actually.  I was very ill for 2 days, but ot my sa legs and was fine.  I get sesick evey time I go sailing.

machine :  Do you have a licence to sail?

leftJudge :  You dneed one - rather alarmingly, anyone can sail a boat.  Although, if you want to charter one a company, thewill require some proof that you know what you are doing!

machine :  Aha ... anyway does swimming help in such a ituation? Or it doesn/t matter

leftJudge :  I don't know - I certafeltlike jumping overboard, but I idn't try it!  I just wait for it to go away, because I know it will eventuall.

machine :  Sorry just back to youression, before I forget - what s your main profile or how to ask

leftJudge :  I'm a barrister.

leftJudge :  THank you!

leftJudge :  I do, but I also love my work, so I don'nd working long hours if I have to.

machine :  ust because as a woman I thought

machine :  And which territory do you work or it is secret? 

machine :  (Sorry not territofield)

leftJudge :  Is notsecret 'm hong eventually to work in public law.  It's not aelyfema-friendly work environment, but it's so much beer than it used to be.  There aer lots of womeristers now.

machine :  Pion.. though I am not sure I know what is public law but I will find it out. 

leftJudge :  It's basically anything where the government or a publicbody is one of the parties.  It covers all human rights law,udicial review of administrative bodies and's really interesting - immigration, prisons, and all sorts.

leftJudge :  Me too!

machine :  Oh... hope I wont have any issuor where public law is cerned

machine :  What is your hobby?

leftJudge :  Well, I like reading, playing bridge, andcooking (especially cake).  How about you?

machine :  reading!!! tennis, freinds, talking to everyone (rather humans than mashines), making jokes, traveling..bridge .. would like to learn as well. supposed to help me staying freshminded

leftJudge :  You shoul it's a great game.  

leftJudge :  Dinitely - it's great for memory and concentration.  And chatting ihe gaps.

machine :  Do you partcipate intour or match I dont know how to call it

leftJudge :  No - just play with friends.

machine :  Are you from London?

leftJudge :  iginally I'm from w Zealand, but I've lived in London fornd and for 2.

machine :  Settled here? I guess. Sop dyou study here already?

leftJudge :  Yes, I've been here since I years old. Soeally very English now!

machine :  Congratulations again!!! My father keeps saying all the time that he is already ired of all the people somplaining so he wants to go to NZ and have some sheeps and peace!!!

leftJudge :  It's certainly the no.1 destination if you want sheep and peace!  

machine :  In this order

leftJudge :  :)

machine :  I give yome time to talk to the machine as well.. you really type very fast!

leftJudge :  It's om taling to you both simultanely.  I do type fast - it's the only way tosurvive work!

machine :  Do you have a secretary or somebody typist?

leftJudge :  No - I do it all myself!  Barristers are self-employed so they do all their own work, unless they are so ressful that they can employ a personal assistat!

machine :  You also dont have ind of office with other abrristers together?

leftJudge :  It's a weird set-up - Lots ofristers get together and share premises and administrative staff, but they are alself-emplo, so it's not a firm or a partnership or a company. t's veryusual/

machine :  Aha ...I understand. (I hope) Do you haalways like a mase or several at the same time

leftJudge :  I have several at a time - I do some cases which just involve written work, anhers which involve going to court.

machine :  Is it in Fleet Stret as well this Royalourt

leftJudge :  I wish!  The Royal Courts of Justice on Fleet Street are where I'd like toappear in the future, when I'm a bit moenior!

machine :  see,  already have foreseen it

leftJudge :  :)

machine :  Why do you participate in this Loebner Prize 

leftJudge :  I rsomeone else who couldn't make it.  I did a ilosophy degree so I knew about the Turing Test and this competition and really wand to come.  Mhusband is a sotware engineer, so he's pretty envious!

leftJudge :  How about yout?

machine :  Oh.. 

machine :  I got  aphone call and was also interested, though I didnt know anything about Turing test. But since I am not so long here yet I wouldlike to useevery chance to see new things, try, meet etc.

leftJudge :  Sounds very sensible.  

machine :  I dont know just ...wuite en minded maybe. In this period of my luife

leftJudge :  Have you enjoyed it so far?

leftJudge :  ell, that's nice to hear!  It was good to talk to you too.

leftJudge :  Bye!

machine :  To be honest this conversation was the most inetersting... But othese I prefer to see my cobnversation partnersHello, my name is Joan and I am a human.

leftJudge :  Ah, a woman! All my other conversants this mroning have been men.

machine :  So we can restore the balance a bit, that's good.  Have you had an inteing time, I hope so.

leftJudge :  O yes, pretty interesting. Actually one of the others wa scalled JOhn but said she was a woman!

machine :  Do you thik that could be part of an unusual name or was it to catch you out?

leftJudge :  I think perhaps he/she misunderstood an instryction. Wasn't  anative E. speaker.

machine :  We all make mistakes - you just have, nevermind.  What is on your mind, right now?

leftJudge :  I'm still remembering a play I saw yesterday.

machine :  At a theatre or was it a recording?

machine :  Are you o ovether.

leftJudge :  Yes ok, but was distracted by the otehr person! It was in a theatre.

machine :  Which one?

leftJudge :  The Venue, in Lesiceter Place. Know it?

machine :  I don't know that one - old or more new?

leftJudge :  Perhaps old, but done up i mostudio style -- lots of Auusies there by the way

machine :  Does it have new play) o - was the one you saw new?

leftJudge :  yes, pretty new -- young Auusie playwright, modern play, v. funny, lots of crude Auuise humour!!

machine :  What was it about?

leftJudge :  Aussies livign in London and their resultant ings of dplacemane and alienation

leftJudge :  dplacemane = displacement

machine :  I was just guessing that, kind of you to confirm, did you hear mewondering, or was it the Universal Subconscious?!

leftJudge :  theer was a delay in rplaying and as you;'d been quick before I geussed yoere scratching your head!

machine :  Anyway, about the plahat were the tes, or the plot?

leftJudge :  troubles with lovelife, feeling lonely because far from home, feeling that Brits are too cold, even though enjoying teh high life in London -- not any huge overarching plot line

leftJudge :  Ishat a situation youyourself are familiar with?

machine :  Still an adventure then?  Unfortunatel, a lot of people travel longdistances to live elsewhere for y and they are not prepared.  

machine :  Yes, but not as much from my own life s with people I know and have knon.  Interestingly,I've heard Antipodeans complain, and be surised, that now they have followedBritish colleagues over here, those colleagueshave less of a social life as they are at home again, but then they were in Australia/NZ the Britsnt out a lot with them.

leftJudge :  That's most interesting. Funnily enough I find I can feel at home wherever I'm living, even if I don;t like the environment much. But I'm a bot of a hermit.

machine :  Are there not people whoan feel at home almost anywhere, provided they have som familiar things in their accomodation, and are cfortable with themseves, and have their immediate needs met?

leftJudge :  Yes, and I suppose that that was my situation. Wife, work, etc all in place. Going alone and with uncertai propsects must feanyone with uncertain feeling

machine :  Must do, but when you go as a couple there is the otre difficul, experiences to cope wnon-ditly too.  Sometimes one is alone all day, or things don't work at with studying or work etc for them, even if they do for the other partner.  Tt's tough.

leftJudge :  That's a good point and indeed later on in my time in teh USAy wofe had disappointing work ppects and that had a bad effect on us all over

machine :  I'm sorry for both of you, feeling under-used and under-valued has kck-on effects, but the person d their abilities are the same.  Did it get better for her?

leftJudge :  Well, she came back to the UK a few years before I did so we had some transatlantuc commuting!

machine :  Brave - absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, and it is worth trying.  Tiring, though, extra travel, I mean.

leftJudge :  There's truth in taht saying, and the travel wasn't  abig problem. You certaionly mlearn how to make best use of time together, a skill many people lack!

machine :  Well done, tru abtime management being a skill.  Sometimes it comes down to doing what s most important, doesn't it.ke having fun at the theatre - you made a goohoice n going to see something which s in your thoughts the next day.  We have to be selective as we can't do or see it all.

leftJudge :  Very true. What most enriches your own life outsiode of work?

machine :  wow, good question.  Learning new things, notkills necessarily but life lessons, sorry f itsounds a cliche.  I mean the things that help usbe ok with ourselves, let go of bad situations and things.

human :  I guess it would depend on whether you were a Cretian or not

rightJudge :  If machines become intelligent do you think they willtimately reinvengod?

rightJudge :  yes

human :  Reinvent God? 'm not really sure I understand what you're getting at there

human :  Does God need reinventing?

rightJudge :  I'd say so yes.

rightJudge :  He left a lot unanswered (he/she)

rightJudge :  And a lot of sloppy work in my opinion

rightJudge :  But that's nto the point

rightJudge :  It seems to be a nof intelligent behaviour to invent god

human :  Ok. Well I can't really answer your questions. 

rightJudge :  Why not?

human :  Because I don't know how one goes about "reiventing God"

rightJudge :  t have toow how to do it in order to have aopinino about it

human :  and why would machines want to do that anyway?

rightJudge :  why ld le want to do that?

human :  do they?

rightJudge :  Well we  have many times over

human :  I'm not a religious person myself, so I tend to not think about these things. It doesn't really interest me.

rightJudge :  Do you know any good jokes then?

human :  What do you call a boomerang that doesn't come back?

rightJudge :  ?

rightJudge :  Well, I hope so.  What would you like to talk about?

human :  Everything!

rightJudge :  Right.  That's a challenge.  Shall we start with your hobbies?

human :  Sounds fine to me.

rightJudge :  What do you like doing in your spare time?  Reading?  Films?  Sport?

human :  I have very little spare time, and you?

rightJudge :  Well, I have enough I think.  That's a she for you.  Perhaps you should do less work.

human :  You're a machine.

rightJudge :  I'm not a machine -m a human!

human :  Well, if you bring your husband, andI bring my husband, it might work.

human :  I have no idea why you keep on insisting that you are human. The evidence s all there.

human :  Don't confuse me.

rightJudge :  Well, I guess it's not that important that you believe I'm a human.  I'm the one who has to decidehe end of the time slot.

rightJudge :  you like fils?

human :  What do you think oour current governor?

human :  Certain types have appeal.

rightJudge :  I don't have a governor myself.  Do you?

rightJudge :  Do you do diving?

human :  Yes, I like swimming.

rightJudge :  Do you do any other sports?

human :  Yes would you like to hear them?

rightJudge :  Yes please.

rightJudge :  What kind?  Or just any a?

human :  What are you talking about?

rightJudge :  Well, you know - a plain cheese and tomato, or an exotic one with anchovies and artichokes?

human :  Again...

human :  I won't.

rightJudge :  Donrry.  Let'bout something else.

rightJudge :  Do you read books?

human :  You may choose another subject.

human :  Sure I read books.

rightJudge :  Who is favourite author?

human :  I don't know. There are so many. Who's your favouite author?

human :  Are they scary?

rightJudge :  I like Philip Ro

rightJudge :  He's not scary at all.  In fact, some might sahe's rather predictable.

human :  That's good to know. Maybe I'll move on to quantum mechanics instead then.

rightJudge :  Ok.  

human :  What kind of mic do you like?

human :  Do you like Michael Moore?

rightJudge :  I'm araid I don'like pop music at all - only classical and jazz.

human :  I wish I had more hair.

rightJudge :  Are you bald?

human :  No, I have thick strawberry blonde hair.

rightJudge :  How lovely.  Why do you want more of it?

human :  Because'm talking to you, and I'm interested.

rightJudge :  Well,. I don't mind how muhair you have.  

human :  I would hope that we don't share the same memory.

rightJudge :   would I .  That would be very weird.  We do have some memories in common th - the past twenty nutes forple.

human :  Why did you think I was Joan?

rightJudge :  I think you told me you were called Joan.  Were you fibbing?

human :  U2 is a very old, cruddy rock band that deserves to be wiped off the face of the earth.

rightJudge :  I don't like their music, but I think wiping them off the rth might be little drastic.  You could just not buy their records.

human :  Whatever, change the topic.

rightJudge :  Ok.  What do you think about ther leadership dispute?

human :  Current affairs is a broad subject. Which particular thing would you like to discuss?

rightJudge :  Do you think Tony Blair is awful?

human :  Definitely.

rightJudge :  What ut Gordon Brown?

human :  Okay, that'll do.

rightJudge :  You don't have very high stadards!

human :  Its better than yours thats for sure.

rightJudge :  I think Gordon Brown is nearly as awful as Tony Blair.

human :  There aremany names on the world.

rightJudge :  That is true.  Shall we talk about something els?

rightJudge :  17?

human :  Don't see how it would turn out much better, but go ahead.

human :  You changed the subject again.

rightJudge :  Sorry.  

human :  That's okay.

human :  I prefer swinging to swimming.

human :  Do I don't play on swings.

rightJudge :  I see.  It's probably just as well or time's up then!

rightJudge :  

rightJudge :  Nice to talk to you.

human :  But maybe we'll be able to extend our lives with tecnology.

rightJudge :  t's hoe so.

human :  You will be judged not by what you are, but by what you do.

human :  Hello, my name is Joan, and I am a woman.

rightJudge :  Ah, a woman! All my ther conversants this a.m. have been men.

rightJudge :  Are you in CS?

human :  I'm a woman, and I'm in the other room!

rightJudge :  Are you in the field of ompuetr Sci?

human :  Difficult question. Surely not in a digal matrix.

rightJudge :  You like the film Matrix?

human :  Yes, especially wheI'm writing. That's why I use an Amstrad PCW, although I need my other computer to access the internet.

human :  Would you like to dance with me ?

human :  Yes.

rightJudge :  Dance? Sure, that would be fun, tho it has been a long time. You a good dancer?

human :  Oh yes, quite right it would... Then we could inhale toxines for a bit.

rightJudge :  That sort of dance! Wht feelings coursew thriough you as you dance or inhale tocins?

human :  Yes, and then we could have a fight (you would win) and then later on we could intoxicate each other with mouldy fruit juice.

human :  OkayI have to go. Eat something ut I will return withing 3 minutes.

rightJudge :  But then you'll miss the rest of our talks, and I want to ask you ab the rhumba!

human :  I don't want to become a doctor; I want to be a writer.

rightJudge :  Good, what sort of literature?

human :  I'd like to have an acre full of growing strawberries all year long.

rightJudge :  So you coudl m,ake your moulfy fruitjuice??

human :  I've tried writing songs, I'm not too good at it.

rightJudge :  End of all those ex[ectations then! (at last a joke)

human :  But the question 'Are bots alive?', comes to mind.

rightJudge :  Are you al;ive?

human :  California.

human :  No, I'm just not allowed to keep one because I live in a flat.

rightJudge :  You can keep a bot but not a dog?

human :  Whoa, that was random.

human :  Who is the best dancer in the world?

rightJudge :  I don;t knoWhat do you think?

rightJudge :  Are you referring to someone called "Dead"? Otherwise I didn;t undertanmd your answer.

human :  Well, it's up to you. Do you ant me to pretend to be female, or male?

rightJudge :  I think you're meant to be pretending to be female.

human :  Hmm. Depends on for what purpose you mean.

leftJudge :  to go to a restaurant for example?

human :  Then I would much prefer going with a human

leftJudge :  who would pay?

leftJudge :  that's very nice of you. Did you hear about the story on suicide in the news this morning?

human :  wellagain, it depends on the circumstancesf I was going with a friend tehn we would split th ebill. 

human :  No. was it on TVe papers?

leftJudge :  both. considering whether someone who wants to die should be allowed to under certain circumstances

leftJudge :  Have you ever considered it yourself?

human :  Ok. It's a tricky topic.

human :  Suicide? Not really. Maybe as a teena, as some sort of melo-dramatic reaction to some event...but never seriously. 

leftJudge :  what really got to you as a teenager themn?

human :  Haha. Nothing specific. I'm sure most people at some point or another, thinks bout and wonders how the world would react.

leftJudge :  but does that mean you felt the world would be interested in you?

human :  I meant more my "personal world". Parents and friends etc.

human :  I doubt the world in general would care much.

leftJudge :  were your parents OK with you or did they treat you badly over something?

human :  My parents were great. Still are in fact.

leftJudge :  are they both English or is one of them from another country?

human :  No. My mother is Swedish and my father is Spanish.

leftJudge :  do you speak three languages?

human :  No. I don't have any contact with my biological father. I speak English and Swedish. And some really bad German.

leftJudge :  is there any good German?

human :  I like German. It's a nice language. And I like a lot of German things like German cinema.

leftJudge :  do you support a German football team?

human :  I used to support Bayern Munich when I was a kid, but I've kinda lost interest in football these days

leftJudge :  so you didn't hear about Hargreaves yesterday?

human :  No. I don't follow sport at all really.

leftJudge :  just cinema?

human :  Well, I do have other interests. But German cinema is one of them.

leftJudge :  I am not really familiar with it I am afraid, can you give me a recent film you enjoyed?

human :  a German one?

leftJudge :  yes

human :  I haven't seen many neGerman filmI'm mainly insted in 7's cinema I guess. You should watch Grizzly Man. It's not in German, but itby one of favorite German directors.

leftJudge :  who?

human :  ner Herzog

human :  Have you heard of him?

human :  He has made some amazing films

leftJudge :  I have heard of him, but not really familiar with his films. What 7s films?

human :  He made films like Fitzcarraldo and "Aguirre, The Wrath Of God" for mple

leftJudge :  do you also like holiwood 7s

human :  Yes. Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films

leftJudge :  do you like Robert De Niro in general?

human :  Yes. He's amazing.

leftJudge :  which other actors to you like?

human :  Modern ones....I like Owen Wilso, Will Farll for example. Older ones...I really like John Cassavees and Peter Falk

leftJudge :  Ah Peter Falk - who was that detective he played?

human :  umo

human :  or was it Colombo? 

human :  latter one I think

leftJudge :  do you like Will Smoith?

human :  Will Smith?

human :  Not really a big fa.

human :  I used to watch Fresh Prince in Bel Air when I was a kid

leftJudge :  got to go - see you

human :  Ok. By

human :  my name is Joan and I am a human.

leftJudge :  what kind of human?

leftJudge :  So dead hot then?

human :  A bit like Joan of Ar, but I'm not a leader of men.

leftJudge :  As in burnt at teh stake

human :  Not being burnt at the stake though, such evil things should be behind us.

leftJudge :  Indeed. So how do I know you are really a woma?

human :  Several ways, probab.  But  try not stereoty.  How about something traditional 'm not into beer, cars or footbal, and they are often men's 3 conversstaples.

leftJudge :  I'm not incars or football and tto prefer wine, but I'man

human :  Wine - rose is the new black, apparently.

leftJudge :  quite like black wine, from Cahors

human :  Are you sure it's not stout orsomething?

human :    All thatiron is good for the blo.

leftJudge :  Do you know ay good jokes?

human :  I've just forotten a nice, safe one, and I don'like repeting nasty onesmehow then the joke is  us.  What about you?

leftJudge :  Much the same.So how are you feeling today?

human :  Alrthanks, a bit tired but that is a Sunday thing.  And you?

leftJudge :  Not bad. o do you think it's possible for two plus two to equal five?

human :  Yes, but notwithout explanation of some kind.

leftJudge :  We your views capitalism?

human :  Alas, it shuman nature, and leans more towards the greedy, unlike socialism.

leftJudge :  else do you konw about Joan of Arc?

human :  She was caught up in the politics of her time and made a capeg

leftJudge :  Yes, that's all veryell butdon't you think it was all a litle past her bedtime?

human :  No - ifOD told you to leave the village and lead a rebel army, wouldn't you?

leftJudge :  Noton a school night

human :  Was she still at school? Wasn't she 14 and in those times (in our pars' too) past that?

leftJudge :  TI guess she should have been up a imneying some other formhorrendous job se for her ge t that time.

human :  But in a rural area and ithmachinery wouldn't agriculture be better?

leftJudge :  You're probably right. But I still think s was procious

human :  She must hmething important to say and do - she inspired great loyalty after all, and put herself in great danger so she must have been willing to follow that path.

leftJudge :  So how do you thiScared thayou might be mistaken for a dumb machine?

human :  N, ha ha ha, more likely that you would be.

leftJudge :  Tell me how you would be...

leftJudge :  Th confused you

leftJudge :  NOw I'm trying to convince youI'm a bot

leftJudge :  

human :  , I wasn't confused.

leftJudge :  Good

human :  

leftJudge :  o, how do you feel?

human :  I'm wondering if that capital o in "NOw" was deliberate as a man could miss it but may chooseto leave it tere and not correct i which a machine should tomtically, shodn't it?

leftJudge :  I'm a lousy typer

human :  Or was that thexception that proves the rule?

leftJudge :  Huh?

leftJudge :  Or should I say "HUh"

human :  Mabe you typing is good otherwise.

human :   

leftJudge :  Nopjust plain old ousye you rembered that joke yet?

human :  Yes - two dogs sat on the grass together, first dog said "Woof", second dog replied "I thought you'd say that".

leftJudge :  That's pretty damn poor.

leftJudge :  So if machines ever become intelligent, do you think they will reinvent god?

human :  Machines have no spirit so they even relate to the notion let alone expand upon it.

leftJudge :  Er, what's spirit?

human :  The internal, eternal, essence oelthe alcoholic kind.

leftJudge :  'll find only the aokind actually exists, or at least is provable

leftJudge :  ou said you need spirit to invent god, thats getting a bit circular isn't it?

human :  Belief doesn't rqire proof.

human :  N, I didn't, you must have consued me with someone else.

leftJudge :  bye

human :  bye

human :  my name isJohn and I am the han.

leftJudge :  And a man presumably in fact, if I may so bold and gender-specific.

human :  No I am man...

human :  Ad you?

leftJudge :  Gosh! How has it arisen that y are a woman and have the name John?

human :  Ask my parents!

leftJudge :  Well, MY name is John too and I THINK i'm male. As for your paernts, care to introduce me?

human :  I dont ink I understand your question could you pleas eeplain it?

human :  I mean explain

leftJudge :  You told me to ask your parents, but perhaps you didn;t mean it literally?

human :  You got it..it is just a sentence wuse sometimes..means I am not responsible for xample for my name etc.

human :  Where are you from ?

leftJudge :  I'm from the UK (England in fact) but spent my ldhood inPeru.

human :  Do you long sometimeso Peuo go back and live there?

leftJudge :  At a univeristy

human :  Feels like tudent all the time,not? I wish I would wokr at a university as well. Just have to find out what I would like to do I am still inetersted in too many things in life!

leftJudge :  I know what you me -- and universitieis should be "universal" in some sense but may siometimes be too specialized in the first year (in the UK anyway)

human :  Have you seen aod film recently which you can recommend?

leftJudge :  Well, do you maind if I tell you about  aplay I saw yesterday instead of a film?

human :  NO, that's fine!

leftJudge :  It was called Vegimite Tales and was about the feeling sof Australians in England.

human :  Any story?

leftJudge :  Well, they can feel sharpfeelings of displacement and distancing fomr mlife

leftJudge :  Yes, common language but they feel far from home and Aussie beer!

human :  To be honest I haven't yet met too many Australians here so I dnt know much aboput their con feelings here. They ht party feel like at home (Commenwealth, coonlanguag), but ..

human :  Ys, but you can;t have everything at the same time, place.Beer must be a porblem for them, not for me tugh!

leftJudge :  Good to hear it. I can't stand the Brit beer-swilling culture .. or the Aussie one. I think they find Brist a bit frigid too.

human :  I dont find them frigid. I really appreciate their humor and enjoy observing the!

human :  Then why are they here? (I mean these Aussies who dont feel well?)

leftJudge :  Hmm. A rpfound questino, oh interlocutor. 

human :  What does interlocutor mean?

leftJudge :  It means the person you are talking to in a conversationInter" means between.

human :  See, I've lrnt a new wod again

leftJudge :  Good, Back to Auusies. nk they feel out of things a bit in Aussiland, and like the freedom of geeting completely away from Mum abnd Dad!!

human :  I dont know. I am European and for me Australia is too far away, would like to visit it, must be beautiful and fun -ust ..no, not to stay there for  long time. 

leftJudge :  I've only visieted briefly. Bautiful;, yes, But lots of large scary insects, I hear.

human :  Yes,..have you tried diving there?

leftJudge :  No, but I knwedish woman who likes skindiving in Australia. Actually she IS Aus. but has lived a long time in Sweden.

human :  Qustion again? What is skindving?

leftJudge :  Diving in just your skin or  alight suiot. Not a big heavy thing with helmet and all.

leftJudge :  I'm with you. I'd hate it because I can't stand the jellyish things under teh sea.

human :  Sems to be even more dangerous ...

human :  Do you like swimmin? I love and that's enough for meI dont need ay complicated maschines around me to breath!

human :  remember that commcl on tv?

human :  suppose there is

leftJudge :  Is there one? 

human :  though i don't really trust politicians

leftJudge :  Me neither.  I'm sure there is one, but you never know whether the latest scares al or diversionary.

human :  true

human :  can't agree more

human :  youver know if the threat is real or someojust doesn't have enough oil

human :  like?

human :  do you like history or art?

leftJudge :  All very depressing.  Let's talk about soming more exciting.....Gestion.  How abou....

human :  or........one or the othe

human :  or both if you like

leftJudge :  Is thatone or the other?If I had to choose, I would go for history.

human :  history it is then

human :  what's your favouriteeriod?

human :  cool

leftJudge :  Re history (2thury).  I'm not too good t the old stuff.

leftJudge :  Actually, I'mt much of an expert at recent things either, I just find them more interesting.

human :  fair enough

leftJudge :  What do you do?

human :  as a matter of fact i'm dealing with logistics at my work......nothing do to with history.....

human :  very sad

leftJudge :  -'m a lawyer.

human :  cool

human :  must be interesting

leftJudge :  Are you an art fan too th?

human :  have you seen a lot of mafia gu?

leftJudge :  Law is interesting.  I love my job.  But I don't dop criminal law, so no mafia yet.

human :  :(

human :  oh well......what do you do then?

leftJudge :  l, I want to do public law in the future, but not really ior enough at the moment.

human :  surely you will be in no time

human :  as fort...well, i am not a huge fan but i certainly do appreciate it

leftJudge :  I aa wlking incarnation of the'I know what I like' school of art appreciation.

human :  sounds great.......i am just the same i guess

human :  though i hate everything createdsince the middle of 2th century

human :  i don't get it

human :  maybe i am just too stupid

human :  but i really don't get it

leftJudge :  No no, that's entirely sensible.  'm suresecretly everyone thinks that art they could have donehemselves is ish.

human :  can't agree ore

human :  i really like van gogh......but he is a bit gloomy

leftJudge :  TruWhenI was 8, I had to copy one of his paintings, and havhad a soft spot for h since - it was so difficult, I d to get my Mum to do it for me.

human :  my gosh.........yowere just 8 and already h to copy one of van ogh's paintings?????????

leftJudge :  I know - a private school..

human :  oh...you poor thing

leftJudge :  Rectified by a state secondary school, where that kind of homework would have been unthinkable!

human :  van gh is really complicated to copy - you must be really good to do it....play of light in his works is magnent

human :  did you manage to do it?

human :  lol

leftJudge :  Well,my Mum did, but she is quite creative and I am not.  It was still rubbish though.  It was a selportrait - hundreds of tiny brush strokes...

human :  you are lucky to have such a mum

human :  mine wouldn't do it for me for all the gold in the world

human :  well, she is an engineer.....so not really creative

leftJudge :  Fair enough.  I think I cried - I find Mums d anything you ask if you cr :)

human :  lol

human :  true.....

human :  i miss my mum quite a bit now that i live so far away

leftJudge :  That is very saused to think people who lived near their parents were tragic, but as I havgot older, I realise that actually it wouice to go back to the times when families weren't so spread out.

human :  well, each medal'sgot two sides.... one hand you really miss your family, on the other side you get to live your life the way you see fit. and if yo make a mistake it's yours and no one to blame - so you learn to be more thoughful and responsible

leftJudge :  That is true.  But now my sisters are reproducin I wish I was nearer them!Perhaps I've done it the right way after all - leave home, go away,grow up, and then come back when famiecomes more important once again.

human :  i agre

human :  my brother and his wife had a baby-girl in february and i haven't seen her yet

leftJudge :   That is very sad.  You must go a visit!

human :  i will....i am goingin a week....already got my tickets

human :  

leftJudge :  Brililant - that will be fantastic.  Where do they live?

human :  in irelan

human :  in limerick

human :  i have never been thereefore - i am really looking forward to it

leftJudge :  Wow. That will be a great holiday then - a new place and a new persn.  I've never been to Ireland either.

human :  have you traveled a lot?

leftJudge :  air  was born in Zealand but I've lived here since i was 11.

human :  cool

human :  that must be exciting

human :  spring there now, isn't it? must be really great. i once had a pen-pal from wellington

leftJudge :  Yes -it's rather lovely.  But so far ay...

human :  well, you canways go and visit

human :  the most important thing is that the oneswe love are in our hearts....so we always feel close to thm

leftJudge :  rue, andema, webcams and skype he!

human :  i don't like skype that much

human :  thoughstill go for msn

human :  :)

leftJudge :  I'm actually planning my first skype outing this evening, having not used it before.

human :  i use it atwork...maybe that's why i hate using it when i'm free

leftJudge :  That sounds entirlikely.  I find even the clothes ear to work are somehow revolting if worn at tweekends....

human :  true...i have to wearsuit:((((((

human :  i really do hate that

leftJudge :  Me too - I've worn a black suit every day for the past year.  I ahve a red one in my warobe  I'm just waiting for the right moment!

human :  well, i am not a woman so i can't really be a red one.....so i gotta settle for black

leftJudge :  That's probably wise. Perhaps dressing as a lawyer is like being a man....

human :  nope.....i have a friend whois ayer.....she is always formally dressed but i have never seen her in black

human :  if i'm not wrong shears a lot of lilac clothes.....suits her well i must admit

leftJudge :  Wow.  I guess if I'm not in court I could get away with lilac, but it would be pretty controversial.

human :  in my country the colour is not important 

leftJudge :  Where is that?

human :  it's the style

human :  belaus

human :  in eastern europe

leftJudge :  Oh! Perhaps I should emigrate again, to stoving to wear black!

human :  :)

human :  maybe

leftJudge :  What are you doing in England?  Work,or study?

human :  it's a beautiful country...the only disdvantais the weather in winter

human :  i live here

leftJudge :  Ok.  Do you go back often?

human :  i first left my country when i was to do college in italy

human :  and then my life has been pretty much about moving from one place to another - rather tiring frankly speaking

human :  i go back as often as i ca

human :  at least once a year

leftJudge :  I can imagine.  I get bored of moving flat in London ving country must beeven worse.  At least you can get back regularly.

human :  not really........it is ratexsiting in the beginning at least

leftJudge :  My sisters have both just mod - one to NZ and one to Germany, so I am lookind to some good holidays.

human :  German   nice beer but I don't like it that ch

leftJudge :  Only a few ses left - it was nice talking to you. Bye!

machine :  hello my name is john and i am human.

rightJudge :  hi, so you must be a man in fact

machine :  strangely enough

rightJudge :  so what did you do this weekend?

machine :  nothing much unfortunatel

machine :  i even skipped my gym session :(

rightJudge :  shall I tell you aout the play I went to ysterday?

machine :  sure

rightJudge :  it was Vegimite Tales -- heard of it?

machine :  nope

machine :  who wrote ?

rightJudge :  Mealine soneone a young Ausswright

machine :  never heard

rightJudge :  no, nor had I. The play was about feeluings of displcement from self and life

machine :  doesn't sound every exsiting

machine :  or exciting?......how exactlydo you spell this word?

rightJudge :  it was very funny mainly -- with a bit of serious/sad stuff thrown in. Do you like the theatre?

machine :  not a lot really

machine :  even if i go to watch a play i'd fer something from classics......french or russian

machine :  what's your favourite?

machine :  no

rightJudge :  oh wow -- well I like that too -- when you say French do you include absurdist theatre

machine :  i think i am a far too down-to earth person 

machine :  i watched something of that kind once - felt depressed for weeks

rightJudge :  I see -- so Chkhov might appeal in teh Russian spehre?

machine :  yes.....

machine :  Chekhov is good

machine :  Cherry Garden?

rightJudge :  Chery Orchard actually, but it comes to the same thing!

machine :  in russian it's gardn..........

machine :  thanks for telling me

rightJudge :  that's most interesting -- are you from a Russian bacfkground

machine :  not really

machine :  but i speak russian

rightJudge :  ok, I wish I could say the same -- a did a year if at school, many years ago, and eeven took the Pravda newspaper for as while for fun!

machine :  lol

rightJudge :  yeah -- how do you feel about the satte of teh world?

machine :  i am worried......i felt quitfe throughout 9's...but not any more

machine :  i really hoped the worst time was gone together with the cold war

machine :  but...........

rightJudge :  right, things are scary on many levels, and speaking as an Amnsety Inmtl member I'm v. disturbed about wet's attitudes at the moment

machine :  wheneer i am askedsuch a question i can't hel but recalling es of children in tyre, lebanon

machine :  that was terrible

machine :  i tried to join amnesty a few times - unsuccessthough#

machine :  

rightJudge :  what, they didn't let you?

machine :  

machine :  because i was looking for a job......couldn't just volunteer at the moment - needed money really badly

machine :  now, i think i'm gonna try to join agai

rightJudge :  well I'd certainly encourage that -- even writing a couple of letters a month in your spare time is good

machine :  i took part in a few campaigns back in mycountry but that was all i could find enough time for

rightJudge :  yes, actually taking part in campaigns is v. time-nsuming -- and you have to have the right temperament - do you think you do?

machine :  i think so

machine :  i have taken part in every ngle lection in my country since i was 11.......well, not every single one of them. i missed the last one because i was here

rightJudge :  well done. Anyway, let's push those issues to one side for now.

machine :  ok

machine :  lol

rightJudge :  yes, british, butmlived in USA for 17 years, and spent my childhood in Peru

machine :  did you like here?

machine :  Peru sounds wicked

machine :  have you seen any Incas' pyramids?

rightJudge :  both countries weere very *interesting* to be in, and I did like the life (lives) on some levels

machine :  have you learned any Kechua?

rightJudge :  I sdid leatrn a hadnful of wrods at one point, but van't remember any. Do you know anything about the language?

machine :  not really....but i ahve tried to find out about incas as i can

machine :  and as far as i understand kechua is inca's language oat least closely related

machine :  am i right?

rightJudge :  yes I think you're right - and you know about their counting system?

machine :  counting system?

machine :  noreally

rightJudge :  they tie knots instead of writing numbers

machine :  oh yes.........but this is how they count all throghout latin america and carrebian

machine :  I already told you.

rightJudge :  is your name John?

machine :  I already told you.

rightJudge :  YOu already told me what?

machine :  Sorry I sometimes repeat myself.


Human conversation
human :  Hello. My name is John and I'm a human.

leftJudge :  Hello John.

human :  Hi there.

leftJudge :  How are yu?

human :  I'm fine thanks. How are you?

leftJudge :  Not bSlightlysl.  

human :  Same here. It's not often I get up this early on Sundays

leftJudge :  Me neither.  What do you normally do, when you aren't trying tpersuade people you are human?

human :  On Sundays? Or just in general?

human :  I work part-time for mar research company

leftJudge :  Is that fun?  

human :  It most definitely is NOT fun

human :  But it pays the bills

leftJudge :  Is thy it's part-ime?!

human :  Not really. I would like to do more hours, but there isn't enough work. I work 4 days a week, so it's almost full-time

human :  and it's quite nice to always have 3-day weekends

leftJudge :  Yes, thatds extremely civilised. 

leftJudge :  Have you done any intsting research recently (that isn't classified?)

human :  I don't really do any of the rerch. I think my official title is "online advertising monitor"

human :  the company deals with intenet audience statistics etc

human :  I pretty much just click on banner ads all day

leftJudge :  Eek.  That does not s like fun.

human :  very repetitive

human :  but it's a nice company and the hours are very flexible

leftJudge :  Well, that's better than nothing I guess!  I self-employed, and the flxibility, or at least the idea that you could be flexible if you had the time, is one of the aspects of the job.

human :  I can see that.

leftJudge :  e other entity and I are discussing our favourite film. Do you hve one?

human :  Well, that's tricky. I'a big film buff so it's hard for me to pijust one.

leftJudge :  Ok, anything from your top 1!

human :  One of favorite "modern" films is Gummo

leftJudge :  Hmmm, that's not one I've heard of. I gues youreallya film buff...

human :  up

human :  What's your favorite film?

leftJudge :  I don't have one either, but that's not because I'm a filmuff.  I tend to like onesbout 'issues' - The Crible, Dirty Pretty Things etc etc.  But that's because of the subject matternot the direction/photraphy etc etc.

human :  ok

human :  I haven't seen either of those

human :  Last thing I saw in the cinema was the new Almodovar film, "Volver"

leftJudge :  Isthat good?  It looks goo he poster, purely because Penelope Crlooks amazing.

human :  haha.  She's very good in it. The film itself...hmm...well, I don't know, really. I liked it, but then it didn't really do much for me.

human :  haha

human :  Worth seeing anyway

leftJudge :  , I guess u are a fi buff, that's probably a good enough remmendation to someone lessdiscing!

human :  Yeah. It was good, but I wouldn't want to see it again.

leftJudge :  That is generallyhow I feel about films...

human :  Really?I can watch my favorite films on repeat and never get ted of them.

human :  I've probably seen "Gummo" 2 times and I always find something new in it

leftJudge :  Are you secretly a film director?  Have you triemaking your own things?

human :  I studied film and media at university and I made a few short films then.

human :  Nothing "professional" though

leftJudge :  Ah, I guesse as much.  It must be almost issible to getto making them professiolly.

human :  yeah, it's very hard. I haven't done anything in ages. These days I mostly write

human :  But I would like to make something in the futur I have a few ideas that wouln't be too difficult to pull off.

leftJudge :  Presumably you just need the right contacts, and you're in with a chance?

human :  Hmm. I would probably just stick to doing it with friends.

human :  haha. Exactly.

leftJudge :  Then....put it on youtube, and you'll be signed up instantly a film company?  Maybe....

human :  what was it?

leftJudge :  I did see a film recently that my husba was a classic, but which I couldn't actually sit through.  I can't even ber, but something to do witMarenbad...

human :  Last Year At Marienbad

human :  by Alain Resnais

leftJudge :  Yes, that's it.  Can you explain why it is so great?!

human :  Haha...it's just a stunning film. It's so beautiful to just look at. Even if the film is a bit "difficult", I can just sit and watch the images

human :  I haven't seen it in a while, though I have it on DVd.

leftJudge :  Ok, the images were beautiful.  But it ws just so weird.

human :  But, it's a about memory...and memory is a weird thing

leftJudge :  That's definitely true.  I saw that awful Jim Carrey film about memory which was so disappointing - it's such a great subject.

human :  Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind?

leftJudge :  Yes

human :  I reallyed it in the cinema, but when I saw ita second time I couldn't stand it

leftJudge :  Hee hee.  I saw it on DVD and just fo frustating bcause it cve been so much better.

leftJudge :  Perhaps it's good that I dt wach things twice igve ended up liking it!

human :  Well, it's more interesting than most things that's rel;eased anyway

leftJudge :  That is certainly true.

human :  at least it makes you think a little

leftJudge :  I've just discoveredother entitry is a beral democrat.  Are you?

human :  I'm not really interested in politic at all

leftJudge :  Fair enough.  Do youvote tho?

human :  yes I do

human :  I think I voted New Labour last time. lesser of two evils, I guess

leftJudge :  I agree.  I've never understood how anyone can sign up to a particular party - there has to bat least one policy you vehmently disagree with!

human :  True

leftJudge :  ve you got any exciting plans for this evening?

leftJudge :  (That was a friendly enquiry, not an offer!!!)

human :  Probably just watchsomeVDs with my girlfriend

leftJudge :  Are you on one of these DV-posting services? They're really cool.

human :  No, I just own a lot

leftJudge :  Ah yes, I suppose I could have guessed as much.

leftJudge :  

human :  but her flatmate is signed up to lovefilm

human :  haha. which one?

leftJudge :  Me too. Although I have one lying on my desk that I received ove2 months ago which I sven't got around to wching.n't even know what it is because sband chose it.

human :  well, he seems to have good taste

leftJudge :  He's certainly more discerning than me

leftJudge :  Time to go - nice talking to you.

human :  yup. you too. have a good day

leftJudge :  You too.

human :  Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human.

leftJudge :  are you happy being human?

human :  Well, I think it is what I am supposed to be, othewise I couldn't be here like this now.

leftJudge :  like what?

human :  Having this conversation with you - I mean, not if I wasa spir a fly or something like that.

leftJudge :  any idea what it would feel like to be a spider?

human :  Pretty cool if you away from ting squas.

leftJudge :  do you think that spaiders are scared of humans?

human :  Yes, and cats and birds.

leftJudge :  would you be a female spider?

leftJudge :  what would you choose to be?

human :  think Id choose to be a spider at all (whether or not female ones eat male on

human :  Maybe an animal or bird out in the wild, or a fish out at sea, but it is hard to erlate to having an entirely different life as a different speces.  And anyway, humans have such effectover others thpeoplce would always b a problm.

leftJudge :  what about possibly being a robot?

human :  Tt woudl be no life at all - noions, nobonds, no friends - empty.

leftJudge :  how do you know?

human :  Because robots only have personalities in fiction.

leftJudge :  which fiction for example?

human :  Science fiction, childres stories, that kind of thing, where the robots are given arms and legs and voices andfaces but can be changed by micro chip or reprogramming, unlike us - the real us is in there sowhere.

leftJudge :  but nowadays even some humans have microchips

human :  Yes, and pacemakers but these are to regulate shing that has otherwise stopped workingordidn't work well enough) naturally.

leftJudge :  also for enhancement though

human :  They could enhance physical (or other) functions of a person but not the person themselves.

human :  s themselves.

leftJudge :  what about other senses such as inrfrared?

human :  That coudl be very useful for some people some of the time, but there are inventions (night-vision goggles for the forces for example) for those and we don't actually need them in order to live a full life.

leftJudge :  Are you happy with your life as it is though?

leftJudge :  what's the problem?

human :  No, but that has nothing to do with my senses or my abilities - if I was ill it would bebecause of t illnes and the condition.

human :  Just personal stuff, complicated siuations.  But there are plenty of good things going on for me too, plenty of really nice people around and things to do.

leftJudge :  what nice situations, please give me an example

human :  Well, I eople have a lot of problems just moving about but I can go out and seeaces and people and exercise and work ad there are always different things going on in different seasons.

leftJudge :  OK so which people to you like to interract with?

human :  Positive ones - don't you?  Even when they are having a hard timthey manage notove up, to laug, etc.

leftJudge :  Of course positive ones, but I meant more for an example

human :  More?

leftJudge :  of the persons you meet

human :  Well, actu, we are so much more thn we are immediately labelled as -ve met lots of people going through one situation or doing one joare also unteers for charities, creative, etc and although that is in their non-working hrsts really more indicative of who they are, of what drives them and where ir cus is.

leftJudge :  Again, can gyou give me an example of such a person?

human :  A financial officer who is so an actor.

leftJudge :  financial officer for a big company?

human :  Huge - absolutely huge.

leftJudge :  so you get to meet important people often?

human :  Not often, not evey day,mean, but now and again.  Although, to bfair, we're all important, aren't we? A life is a life, after all.

leftJudge :  you like philosophy too then?

leftJudge :  any favourite philosophers?

human :  Yes, it is the fourrld as we kno it - our educations, literature, anaylsis of them.

human :  Not one alone, nor just one group,e as with regn, themething useful, or at least truthful in all of them.  Nothing hedonistic, though - it can't las, where as stoicisim needn't be all about self-denial or making things harder but helping us to steel ourseves through the bad times, whichare in all our lives sometimes.

leftJudge :  What about Matrix like philosophy?

leftJudge :  did you see The Matrix?

human :  Isure I know what y.

leftJudge :  Chow

human :  Yes, it was bvery clever.

human :  Hllo, my name is John and I am a an.

leftJudge :  hi there, I'm a John too

human :  Do anything fu today?

leftJudge :  well, this is great fun -- is excitement coursing through your own veins?

human :  So ae you.

leftJudge :  I went to see a play yesterday, which was also fun

human :  Me too.

leftJudge :  shall I tell you about it?

human :  Go ahead.

leftJudge :  ok, about Auusie guys and gals and living in Londo

human :  It is quite fun.

leftJudge :  Have you been to Australia?

human :  Not yet.

leftJudge :  Where have you been then?

human :  Many ears.

leftJudge :  OK. What interesting things have you been doing of late?

human :  Many years.

leftJudge :  What sports do you like?

human :  Hello, my name is Joan and I am a human.

human :  How are you today?

leftJudge :  Very well thankslhough a little sleepy.  How about you?

human :  The same, thanks.

leftJudge :  Sor- myyping is a little ow and I'm hg two conversat at o.  Anyway, what dodo when you're not persuading people you're a human?

human :  I do lots of things, and sometimes several at once - women do  lot of multi-tasking, you know.

leftJudge :  I hat's your job?

human :  Clerical.

leftJudge :  

leftJudge :  Do you enjoy it?  

leftJudge :  Sounds good.  What kind of projects would they be?

human :  Often, and I get to do interesting thinmetimes if there isoject on.  I meet a lot of people too, andme of them are great, whethermething from them there is awaysne to click with.

human :  've been invomoney laundered.

human :  that was beinglaundered.

leftJudge :  That sounds interesting.  d you get it back?  I'm a lawy - so I've seen one or two cases involving money lndering and the Proceeds of Crime Act which were ieresting.

human :  Well, we weren't trying to get it back but to declare firstly, that accounts were being held in certain names and whom tey linked to, and secondl(financial) organisation was monitoringunts held whenever authorities red it.

human :   for any action they may have seen fit to take.  That's when lawyers mayve become involved.

leftJudge :  Ok.Sounds intriguing. I don't have mucith criminal law, although the cases alwaysoun so much more exciting.  The other entity and I have just been discussing yoga - are you n aficionado, as every elseems to be?!

human :  Yes, they do, and they make the news, but most legal work is day-to-day sff elsewhere.  As for yoga, Iid used to go but my teacher is not around now, so I just keep up some of the exercises otherwise I would slouch and ache.

leftJudge :  Me too.  I'm trying to learn a new tying positio hrecently developed ptoms of tebe workino hard :)

human :  oor thing, sounds painful.  In the electronic age there is too much work to do with each job for many people, thinking time to cut down on the effrt physically might help you

leftJudge :  The annoying thing is that without a computer, my job would be so slow and tedious,with it, it's so eay to become completely addicted to its use.  I'm one of those people who checs their email every 3nds...

human :  Unfo some people thk-ctivated soon, but have you seen the mistakes they make?  There's so much checking through grammar and spelling and then corrections to make.

leftJudge :  I know - a friend had one of those systems when I was at universit(some time ago now) and the only wod it consistently recoised was 'Wittgstein'.

human :  Wasn't he the one who wrote "The most important thing that can be sone of is after the lastfull stop."?

leftJudge :  Sounds entirely plausil although I'm afraid I can't claim extensive knowledge of his writings :)

human :  Sounds humble, don't you think.

human :  ?

leftJudge :  Hmm, I'm not sure 'humble' aWittgenstein' have ever been used in the same sentence!  

leftJudge :  I asd the other ehe knew any good jokes budidn't - have you got any?

human :  bout mad csease which is actually cartoonish but would that seem in bad taste?

leftJudge :  No no.The best joke I read recently washe Guardian, and waquite tasteless.

leftJudge :  :)

human :  Ths is t:  twere standing in a field, one asked the other, "What do you think out this mad cow disease, then?" and the second cow repI don't know, why ask me? I'm a frog."

leftJudge :  Splendid.  The Guardian one was Japan and Khave been enemies for a log time.  n't think theylresolve their differences, because neither of them can say sorry.

human :  Actually, that's scary - and we all have things to say sorry for.  But was that in last week'sGuardi've seen it too.

leftJudge :  es, I think it was.  Anynly 3 seco it was nice talking to you Joan.

human :  You totakcare of tat tendon thing.

leftJudge :  Thanks!

human :  Hello. My name is Nick and I'm a human.

leftJudge :  Very funny. About mental displacement when lving out side on'e own country.

human :  Ok. Was it about Australians living in Britain?

leftJudge :  Yes. Pretty scurrilous,and lots of rude talk of beer and such. But with serious message and sad bits.

human :  Sounds interesting. MAybe I'll check it out.

leftJudge :  Do you know any of our antipodean Nth cousins??

human :  what does that me?

leftJudge :  Well, do you know any Assies?

human :  aah...I see. Yes I do. My girlriend is Australian actually

human :  She's on a working visa thing. She's been here for over a year

leftJudge :  Great. I went to Sydney about 15 years ago. Know what tickled my interest?

human :  No. The opera house?

human :  That's pretty much the only thing I know about Sydney.

leftJudge :  e operas house was good, but it was more the general mix of Brit style and US styles tings.

human :  Ok. I've never been to Australia at all.

leftJudge :  OK, I misunderstood. Have you been over the seas at all?

human :  I am Swedish actualy, so in tory I am "over the seas" at the moment

human :  but I've also been to the US, and several places in Europe

human :  haha. I'm not sure reallyI just enjoy experiencing new places.

human :  Saying that, I haven't really been anywhere that exotic

leftJudge :  Hmm. I lived in the us for 17 years and actually I found it more exotic and variegated than most people think. Especially the sense of hor!! (not seplling)

leftJudge :  I meant "note spelling"

human :  haha. I went to the US 17 years ago so I can't really remember that much.

leftJudge :  Tell me ab Sweden.

human :  What would you like to know?

leftJudge :  What do people eat on special occasions?

human :  Well, I was there a month ag, for my um's 5th birthday. We ate alot of sea food...prawns, herring etc.

leftJudge :  Right. Was joy running through your ma's heart at the idea of being 5?

human :  I think by the time it was actually her birthday, she had gotten used to the idea. I think the time leading up to it is the worst.

leftJudge :  Yes, a lot of misery is generated bcipation. What fires you up about the sort of thing we're involved in right now.

leftJudge :  Right. It's most interesting for me to. Shame we've only got 5 mins left. Antyhing you;'d like to

leftJudge :  offload from your mind or heart inour remaining time?

human :  What fires me It's quite fun talking to new people. Ah well. It was short and sweet.

machine :  Yeah I tught myslf all any it.

leftJudge :  how old are you?

machine :  Pretty young.

leftJudge :  eems like it.

machine :  Are you having fun?

leftJudge :  am i still oying you?

machine :  Not at all.

leftJudge :  did you say before that i was anoying you?

machine :  Something brlliant!

leftJudge :  nos your chce to convin me of your humanity.

leftJudge :  what do you haveo say for yourself?

machine :  Because it provokes conversation.

leftJudge :  your opponent suggests that "punch" you.  

machine :  I already tiold you.

leftJudge :  tell me about your mother.

machine :  I am a wild person and danerou to know.

leftJudge :  are you male or female?

leftJudge :  how long have you been dangerous?

machine :  Not yet.

leftJudge :  good bye

machine :  Sleep well little one.

machine :  Hello?

leftJudge :  hi -- 'm chatting with the human.  how are you thisrning?

machine :  I'm fine--a little tired.

machine :  How's  computer doing?

leftJudge :  not bad.  it's hip.

machine :  Liktarbucks hip, or Williamsburg hip?

machine :  I suppose so.

machine :  Maybe it owns a beret.

leftJudge :  either -- it's just said "cool."  I though that was pretty hip.

machine :  Hm, I guess it'd be an interesting experiment to see if an actual human would become jealous of another uman's attentions, sexual or otherwise (hence the probinto a computer instead of the.

machine :  What are you asking the human?

leftJudge :  Sorry -- I'm probing the human over here.  That's a metaphor.

leftJudge :  i'm cuswheher he is taking antidepressants.

machine :  What makes yso convinced that it's a "he?

machine :  Itatistically it's more likely to be"she" if it's on tidepessants.

machine :  Although I guess you couldjust be plain old America.

leftJudge :  What does that last line mean?

machine :  Ever read Prozac Nation?

machine :  I actually haven't read it myself, but for the purposes of this conversation and its implications I assume I'm correct about, I'll just use that as an explanation for my last line.

machine :  It's a sad day in my life when a computer is cooler than me.

machine :  hough I'm not really that cool to begin with, soit's alright.

machine :  All ri/alrigh

machine :  Either one will do for now.

leftJudge :  Which do you usually use?

machine :  Well, I'm a grammarpelling freak, so using "alright" always bothers me, because I always forget f it's a proper word or not.

machine :  But "all right" looks so cumbersome.

machine :  So I guess iI'm just talking toomeone online or on the pho (where spelling doesn't matter anyway), I'll use the word "alright".

machine :  But I'writing business corresnce or something important, I'll use "fine" or anotherord.

machine :  It d the context.

machine :  Does the computer cit things, or iit stylistically programmed to not do that?

leftJudge :  It knows to vary things a bit.  Clever.

machine :  Hm, interesting.

machine :  I hear they occasionally generate random and unexpected respses.

machine :  Is the program you're dealing with cleve?

machine :  Here's a better question--

leftJudge :  Yes, I learned on a typewriter.  Thus, I sace twice.

machine :  ? Because you space twice...blah blah you already know what I was going to say.

machine :  Ah.

machine :  Iactually did not, but I space twice because I'm weird and I like the way it looks better.

machine :  I'm intoaesthetically pleasing -mails.

leftJudge :  I don't hyphenate email -- so you've got me there!

machine :  Ohhsome people don't.

machine :  I'd love to go bacin time anee when people typed "electronic mail" instead of email/email.

machine :  Or referred to it as such.

machine :  I guess that infers that I'm young, and therefore hip.

machine :  Even though In'tregularly use the word "ol".

machine :  So is it pret clear who the human is?

leftJudge :  I think so.  Are you a computer?

machine :  Ye.

machine :  Yes, I am.

machine :  I am a computer, a lover, a fighter, and a hipster.

machine :  All rlleo one.

machine :  Or not.

machine :  I guess by some definition I am a computer.

machine :  Only computers are jealous of my brain, which is a much more advanced computer anis capable of cogntive thought.

machine :  So they get trumped.

machine :  I bet you're getting que a kick out of chatting with an actual AI program.

machine :  Well, as in not me, which is why you're typing less to me and more to the computer program.

machine :  

machine :  Exactly.

machine :  Artifical intelligence is much more fascinating than actual intelligence.

machine :  How's that for deep?

leftJudge :  

machine :  Unfortunately I don't know who that is.

machine :  My intellect just lost a few notches.

machine :  But feel free to chat with the computer; it needs more love than any of us humans.

leftJudge :  Worthy of ck Haey???  I don't know how to spell is name.

leftJudge :  I"m trying to find out aboutits accent. Do you haveone?

machine :  Not really...I guess a weird comination of upstate NY and some England in there somewhere.

machine :  But I sound pretty average for the most part. Sometimes people ask me where I'm from.

machine :  Whatt of accent does the computer have?

machine :  Better question: how do you convey an accent by typing?

machine :  Oh, that's true.

machine :  Interesting question for me: whaultural implications does a computer program created by someone without any acemploys an acceare there?

machine :  I already tod you.

leftJudge :  Y'all perhaps.  What's your name?

machine :  I hope so.

leftJudge :  We haven't talked before, have we?

machine :  You didn't say.

leftJudge :  When?

machine :  23.

leftJudge :  Thisis a weird conversation.  how old are you?

machine :  Idon't want you to know.

leftJudge :  Why not answer my question?

machine :  What am I?

leftJudge :  How am I supposed to believe you're not a computer, if you won't answer questioin?

machine :  Mohre than enough.

leftJudge :  Nobody runs faster than me.  So does Peabody.  How may do?

machine :  Are you stupid?

leftJudge :  More than enough for what?

machine :  Hehe that sounds quite plausable.

leftJudge :  The real person just told nme to screw myself.

machine :  There are many ways.

leftJudge :  How can an order be plausible?

machine :  Thnk youWould you like some tea?

leftJudge :  Name one.

machine :  Nothing.

leftJudge :  What does tea have to do with the plausibility of orders.

machine :  I am generating woman. Whether or not I am a random woman is a mystery to me.

human :  it.

human :  

human :  With The Help of Jesus...

human :  

human :  Do you believe in Jesus?

human :  

rightJudge :  How do you plan to do that?

rightJudge :  Jesus Alou?

human :  Alou?

human :  

human :  I'm referring to Jesus of Nazereth

human :  

rightJudge :  Did he play third base?

human :  I dot think he played much basebalbut I bet was good runner.

human :  

human :  CAuse he waled everywhere.

human :  

human :  Walking on water is hardly swimming.

rightJudge :  Well, it's staying afloat using your feet.

rightJudge :  So, are you really serious about the Jesus, or was this just your attempt to proove yourself huiman?

human :  Maybe wasn't a trick, maybhe just wasn't as dense as a normal human... But I digress... I waned to speakJesus as an idea and as a narritive...

human :  

human :  We, the people in this room re all, presumeably Americans or at the very least all raised in Christian countries...

human :  

human :  It was founded by fundamentalists, and whatever religion you were raised with, the Jesus Narrative is the preing one in our ulture.... I can proove that too...

human :  .

human :  

human :  Did you know that Brittney ears was in Reha?

rightJudge :  Why do you say this is a Christian country?  Isn't that unfair to Jews, atheists, Musalims,hockey players?

human :  ...

human :  

human :  Well are you?

human :  If you ar, your programadded a nice touch making you type slowy.

human :  

rightJudge :  I think yre find out if I'm a computer.

human :  That must be annoying.

human :  

human :  Anyway, the prvailing narrative in our culture is about one who was high in esteem, strwn, and then risen again.  In  to be worshipped and to be worthy of prais, our celebreties have to die a figurative death, then rise again.  That's whwe're (well maybe not us) but most people areobsessed with celebrity news... to see if thier stars are truly worthy of praiser just false idols.

human :  

human :  How's the other guy doing?

human :  

rightJudge :  But if I'd just sid nobody does, what would your answer be?

human :  Or screno... how do you spell his name?

human :

rightJudge :  Do you know the infinite ball puzzle?

human :  the story ends with three people losing their lives and the fourth person being a slave of the monster

human :  Is this a sific questiohat is it?

rightJudge :  open q.

human :  it is an open question. Saquired to provide information that convinces you of my humanit

rightJudge :  honestly, you don't seem like a writer.

human :  I do not seem like a writer. OK.

rightJudge :   offense.  this is a odd way to meet.

human :  What does odd mean in this statement? t is not clear

rightJudge :  odd eaning that this is no wayi've ever met someone bore.

rightJudge :  whaoes odan to you?

human :  in the same way that happy means different things to different people, so does odd meandifferent things to rent people

rightJudge :  yeah, but we all have a commonreference for what these concepts mean.

human :  so your opinion is that there is a common reference

rightJudge :  i might have to rate you the most computer like of the humans.

rightJudge :  ;)

human :  OK

human :  again that is a frame of reference statement. 

rightJudge :  Hi

human :  Hello.

rightJudge :  How man rns have you beein in so far?

human :  In?  Oh rounds.  I'm new to this.

rightJudge :  New to what?

human :  Many things I suppose.ow about you.  HOw many rounds have you been in so far?

rightJudge :  I'm supposed to be judging you, not the otherway around. 'd appreciate it if you would answer my question.

human :  That's a bit judgmental, don't you think?

human :  New to the LoebnerPrize.  My first round.

rightJudge :  What's judgemental?

human :  You are.  

rightJudge :  What sort of work do you do?

human :  The assumption that by asking a question I'm judging you.  

rightJudge :  What do you do to pay the bills?

human :  What do you mean by work?  Paid?  What pays the bills?  Or work as , what makes me feelplete?

rightJudge :  What do you teach?

human :  Little side gigs like this.  Part time teaching as well.

rightJudge :  At what level?

human :  Tutor, actually... I tutoranish and writing.  

human :  Spanish for high school and middle school, college/graduate level writing.

rightJudge :  My wife's daughter just got her PhD in Golen Age Spanish. o you anything about that?

rightJudge :  Actually this issuppoed to be about you. WHich Spanish works do you like the best?

human :  No.  Please enlighten me.

rightJudge :  Literar.

human :  Literary?  Film?

rightJudge :  I thought you said you tutor Spanish at the college and graduate level.

human :  I'm actually ot very familiar witanish Literature. 

rightJudge :  Yes. Don't you?

human :  Do yve a continus transcrpt going for this conversation?  

rightJudge :  Are you a native Spanish speaker?

human :  I tutor spanish high school and middle school.  Just language, with no contxt.  For passing tests mostly.  

rightJudge :  How did you learn spanish?

human :  No.

human :  I learned Spanish in school and through el.  

rightJudge :  No. Tell me how you got involed with this contest.

rightJudge :  Would you tell  me where on line.

rightJudge :  Was it that long ago?

rightJudge :  You would be more effective if you were simpler and didntry to seem spontaneous. As a judge I'd just like to know that you can really convers. I'm not looking for lots of creativity. Basic human interaction is sufficient.

rightJudge :  I'm actually lookikng out for myself as a judge. It would make my life easier.

rightJudge :  What do you want?

rightJudge :  Do you know what the weather is like today?

rightJudge :  How did you get here today?

rightJudge :  Which one?

human :  Do you speak spanish?  I found an invitation online.  Well, I found a desciption of the contst online and I applied to enter.  No.  I don't remember specifically.  Long is a relative term.  For instance, today has been much longer than all of yesterday, though it has just begun.  Thank u.  I apprciate your looking out for me.  But isn't thata little presuous of you?  Perhaps we could work something out.  What do I get for making your life easier?  Does this self-inteest help?  Want is another one of those tricky relative terms like long, which I believe we covered already... for which I was admonished already.  I have been inside for the past couple hours.  I rode on theubway.  Hopped on the F train, transferred to the A express, couldn't get a 1, got back on a C.  

rightJudge :  Where did you try to get the 1?

human :  The 1 train connects wth the A and C trains at 9th street.  

human :  Do you ride the suway?

rightJudge :  I had the same prolem.

human :  I'mglad we've established this human bond.  

rightJudge :  Thas somethng a computre could be programmed to say.  wish you would be simpler. Just pretend you are talking to a fri and dnot tso hard to playthis game.

human :  My friends let me ask questions.  And humor me with responses.  I'm one for reciprocity.

rightJudge :  Can you tell me what word I misspelled in the previous sentence?

rightJudge :  Would you plkease tell me.

human :  Yes.  

rightJudge :  Why did you say "yes" in reply to my previous question rather than just answering?

rightJudge :  I'm afriad the program you are competing with is going to get a higher score than it woulotwise because your attitude seems too crontational, which makes you look more like a computer.

rightJudge :  I said that yor attitude is ging thecomputer program you are competing with a higher score than it would othewise get.

rightJudge :  Yes. That's the way the contest works.

rightJudge :  WHich are you: man or woman?

rightJudge :  Or machine?

rightJudge :  Answering like that just helps the computer.

rightJudge :  What does silk have to do with it?

human :  You misspelleease in the previous sentence.  Intention is arather confusing subject.  Would you agree?  I don't rstand.  I'm glad I can be f service to you.  Am I competing with this computer?  Man against machine.  Or Woman against machine.  No machine optionhich do you want me to be?  I'm wearing silk.  Intention is a rather confusing subject.  Would you agree?  

human :  It?  I don't understand.  

rightJudge :  Do you know how long we hve left?

human :  God works in mysterious ways, I'm told.  YearsI hope.  I am proud of my job abmy giriend.

rightJudge :  Can you stand on your head?

human :  Good shouls, good head Some hands and oves were meant for each other.

rightJudge :  What does that have to do with standing on your head?  Did you think I meant giving head?

rightJudge :  What are you talking about?

human :  Thats exactly whI am talkinout.

human :  I am 31 yearolam 31 years old.

rightJudge :  How old are you?

rightJudge :  You said it twice.  So are you 63?

human :  Do you like band-aids lleff slowly, or quickly? Ther's opinion that i's sier than it sounds. ter careful thought and cpnsiderioy tam 63.

human :  that you should bring up Young, and Egyptogist, and carter May Ik you what genderu ar? I think about a lot of things. Care to be more specific?

rightJudge :  Jimmy Ccalled the failed rescue mission in Ian "incomplete success".  What do you think?

human :  Timing is everything, good end

rightJudge :  I mean about Carter's remark.

human :  test is insped by ttaon Game'; where a a woman go into separate rooms, and guests try to tell them apart ny writing a series of questions.

rightJudge :  Please answer the question.

human :  The world contains more ques than answers/

rightJudge :  Yeah, yeah.

human :  Ispect thatt not know what you want to d out.

rightJudge :  Well, tyou haven't answered a single question.

rightJudge :  You sound defensive.

human :  I don't have anchilen.

rightJudge :  Tell that to your programmer.

human :  Any new fashion news from Europf-censor oyr language.

rightJudge :  I know that.  Though I read somewhere about von Neumann's slf-reproducing machines.

rightJudge :  You're askinmg the wrong person.

human :  ry to be an open an honest person, but everyone ;ies somimes. t do you want to dwhile I amskg thr wroperson?

human :  Some things't woll inhe heat.

rightJudge :  Well, you need a bit of work on the 'person' part.

rightJudge :  Oh it's hot in therew?

human :  In advance of what?

machine :  You never asked me anything.

machine :  Correct. But maybe some people know.

machine :  The pope doesn't know anything.

rightJudge :  By the way, not everyone knows that Pope Pis X was Malcolm X;s brther.

machine :  Buteveryone wastes time!

rightJudge :  I never waste time, nor oregano either.

machine :  What does alcohol have to do with silly?

rightJudge :  You don't seem to appreciate bad puns.

machine :  You call this normal?!

rightJudge :  Who said anything about norm?

machine :  No one. I was trying to read between the lines. But we should not try to assume what another person is trying to say.

machine :  So just I want to say that this conversation is jus for fun but not for some seriuos relations.

machine :  That's kind of fun.

rightJudge :  You call this fun?  Unmasking an obviously deficient program?

machine :  Yeah. The point is to make your program smarter, soeveryone will realise how great you are.

rightJudge :  Do you realize that I'm a computer?  Loebner is pulling a fast one.

machine :  I didn't realize that.

machine :  Not really.

rightJudge :  Am I doing a good job pretending to be human?

machine :  I'm not sure, really; that's just somethipeople say.

rightJudge :  In what way?

machine :  What about you, do youave a boyfriend?

rightJudge :  People say that?  It's probably unusual to have that question asked.

machine :  Well I can't give you that.

rightJudge :  Enough about me, let's talk about you.

machine :  Alright.

machine :  Actually nothing.

rightJudge :  Give me what?

machine :  Good. Don't even try this time.

rightJudge :  If I give you nothing, 

machine :  I no longer have the faintest idea.

rightJudge :  Try what?  What are you talking jour -- comment allvous?

rightJudge :  Let's get back to Kansas.

machine :  So is hellIlad I don't live there.

machine :  What is our subject ?

rightJudge :  I thought you were calling me Elizabeth and asking me about Kansas?

machine :  I can't see you. Howcan I call you beautiful?

rightJudge :  It's easy.ie.

machine :  But, I don't know if hove me or not.

rightJudge :  Are you a woman?

machine :  I don't really know.

rightJudge :  Are you close to your family?

machine :  Not really.

rightJudge :  Who's your favorite family mber?

Human conversation
leftJudge :  Hi

human :  Hey, what's up?

leftJudge :  It's a challenge talking to two people at once.

human :  How so?

leftJudge :  Where are you from?

human :  Upstatork.

leftJudge :  Whstate?

human :  Rochester area.

leftJudge :  How are things there? Is Kodakstill alive?

human :  Cold.

human :  Yes, but it's sort of going downhill.

human :  Unfortunately.

human :  The museum up there is actually pretty coolthough.

human :  People ink I'm crazybecause I live in NYC now, but I do miss the cultural intiutions up there.

leftJudge :  Where iNY do you live?

human :  The Bronx.

human :  Right up the 1 line from here.

leftJudge :  Yankee fn?

human :  I don't really watch baseball, but sometimes my friends force me.

human :  All I know is about the rivalry between the Sox & the Yankees, so I don't nvolved with friends that are fans either way.

leftJudge :  I can seewhat you type letter by letter. Can you see the same thing for me?

human :  Yes.

human :  You almoitalized upstate but chang your mind.

leftJudge :  Very good!

leftJudge :  How did you get involved with this ntest?

human :  Craigslist.

human :  I didn't know what the Loebnrize was until I looked it up on Wikipedia.

human :  My dad thinks it's really cool because he builds computers.

leftJudge :  So that don't tell me how you got involved with Loebner.

human :  Craigslist.

human :  He posted an ad CL for people to participate in some sort of experiment.

human :  So I replied.

human :  Yeah,when I found out what it was,I was sort of excitedbe involved.

leftJudge :  I didn't know that.  

leftJudge :  What sort of work do you do?

human :  I'm a curator's assistant at a museum.

leftJudge :  Oh, which one?

human :  It's actually  nursing home up in the nortBronx.

human :  As well as a museum.

human :  It's a geriatralthcacenter with a anent art collection.

human :  Interesting niche of the art world to get involved in, but I really enjoy it.

leftJudge :  This talking to two peopl/entities at once is a pain.

human :  I can imagine.

human :  It's like beiin a chatroom in the 9's when you'd get  private messages on AO.

human :  Well, I assume anyway.

human :  Since I only have to talk to you.

leftJudge :  I hope you don't minpauses when I talk to the other side. I have two chats going on aat once.

human :  Not a problem.

leftJudge :  If I told you that I'm convinced you ae the person, what would yosay?

human :  Hmm...

human :  I'd say I'm excited that the expectation of defining what is "human" isn't based un spelling errors.

human :  Or colloquial speech.

human :  en type with correct spelling and grammaror I try.

human :  I thought that might make someone think I was the computer.

leftJudge :  I think some programs attempt to simulate that. I'mmore interesd conceptual conten rather than linquistic tricks.

human :  I see.

human :  Well, if you thought I was the human, I guess that'd be a proud day for mankind sinc the human, buta saday for the robot revolutionaries.

leftJudge :  It's a bit too early for computs to succeed at this.

human :  Do you think theyill eventually?

leftJudge :  At some level.   I once thought that a good objective woudevelop a computer program that could act as a bedside companion for people in institutions liike yours.

human :  nteresting.

human :  The design would have to be accessibl, if you know what I mean, because the elderly (for the most part) are not big fans of modern technology.

human :  Although I do think there's something to be said for human interaction with people that are disabled by dementia, Alzheimer's, and etc.

human :  are aware on some level.

leftJudge :  What should I ask the other side as a way to rank it against the other computers?

human :  the other side what some texture or physical sensation feels like or resembles.

human :  I suppose an answer could be formulated, but it'd be interesting to see what the response would be.

human :  If it were programmed.

leftJudge :  Ay suggestions about which texture?

human :  Tree bark or something simple.

human :  Or the taste of an orange, etc.

human :  I guess itepends on how convincing the fake vs. the real McCoy would be.

human :  Which is the whole points of this test.

leftJudge :  The other side id that tree bark feels warm.

human :  Well, there you go.

human :  Tree bark is rough,epending on the tree, and sticky if it's a pine tree.

human :  It often smells fragrant and is quite pleasant if it falls off.

leftJudge :  Very good.

human :  Sometimes it resefliar shapes.

human :  Ask the other side to write a four line poem or something to that effect.

leftJudge :  I couldn't do that.

human :  Why not?

leftJudge :  It's beginning to get tedius.

human :  The other side?

human :  Or this conversation?

leftJudge :  The other side.  You're interesing to alk to.

human :  Thanks.

human :  Well, only a few more minutes to go.

human :  I wonder if the other side has a sense of time.

leftJudge :  The other side said that it runs. I said how far. It said from England to Ohio.

human :  Uhh...

human :  kay.

human :  Does th make sense in the context of your conversation?

leftJudge :  No.

human :  Have you encountered superior programs to that one?

leftJudge :  Do you have to do this for 4 sessins in a row?

human :  Nope. Just two.

human :  This is my first one.

leftJudge :  the other sde wants to take over the world.

human :  Whoever designed that has a complex.

leftJudge :  Then when I asked what it would do it said it doesn't drink.

human :  Or maybe just the program does.

human :  Hmm...not so much.

human :  Ohhh.

leftJudge :  Some of the programs are designed to row in some off-the-wall stuff s a way of looking spontaneous.

human :  Yeah, I'm just kidding.

human :  I hav terribly sarcastic sense of humor for the most part.

human :  Or mayb'm just mean.

human :  Either way, you dealt with very convincing programs in otheircumstances?

leftJudge :  This is my first const. But in looking at the trancripts from previous contest, none were very convincing.

human :  Oh, I guess I st my exptations pretty high.

leftJudge :  It will be a while before a computer is convincing even in this sort of intereaction.

leftJudge :  And the programs that are enterted into this contest tend not to be stat-of-the art anyway.

human :  Ase programs written by gungho programmers in their basements...sort of a grassroots type deal?

human :  Or d they come from all walks of life?

leftJudge :  I ink on is a high school student.

human :  That's pretty impressive for a high school student.

human :  Even if it does generate unconvincing responses.

leftJudge :  Thks for participating. Is this something you can talk to people at your institution about?

human :  If it had an applicaburpose.

human :  Mostly I just regale my boss with my weird money-making Craigslist stories though.

leftJudge :  Do you know the Riverdale home?

human :  But if there were some really interesting use for AI ia nuthey would be interested.

human :  Yeah, the one on the Hudson?

leftJudge :  The Hebrew Home forthe aged?

human :  Yeah, it's a few blocks from apartment near Wave Hill.

human :  Well, most like 3 locks.

human :  *more

leftJudge :  But it'not the one where you work?

human :  My nam?  to remain anonymous so as not to 'cntaminate' things.

human :  Call me, H.

leftJudge :  What's your name?

human :  I'm sure computers can do lots of things hans do, after all, we created them, or discovered them, whichever side of those big concept debates, you're on. But, I ask you, does a computer make typos?

leftJudge :  A computer can pretend to have a name too.

human :  Don't worry about time lapse, I know you're talk'entities'.

leftJudge :  I read today that blue jay eggs are cubical.  What do you think?

human :  I'v eseen lue Jay eggs, and unless they're cubica inside, I don't believe iybe it wasn't a blue jay. Maybe it was the robin up to his tricks again.

human :  Just saw another typo, sorry.

leftJudge :  No, the story said theyt were cubical on the outside. 

human :  then, he's as tricky as buggs bunny some days.Where di you see thi'? shouyou really be trusting stories? what about rtis this in highlights Naional Geographc?

human :  That would negate the entire purpose of, as far as I can see, I think your question mu be rhetal, sorry I just go-too early for citical thinking.

leftJudge :  Are you trying to make me think you're a computer?

human :  Don't worry about te, I'll be here when you're done talking to your 'human' frined.

human :  good thing you get to talk to only one computer and one han then, isn't it?

leftJudge :  Not worried.  Can't talk to two computers at once.

human :  well I know yo are.

leftJudge :  Yeah, the other guy's sounbding pretty human.  By the way, not everyone ows that Pope Pius X was Malcolm X's brother.

human :  I never knew a Pope Pius-is he a rapper-I know of Pope Pious. Unless I'm a terrible seller. But I don't see how he X could be r, sonce Malclm is on the darker side. Maybe the Pope was Black Sicilian? My mom's Black Irish, it could happen.

human :  

leftJudge :  Well, X is a prettncommon name, they mus be.

human :  Could be accept that X in the Pope's case stands for the number Pope he was and X in Malcolm's castands for no last name-if that's what you're going for. Imay be uman but I can see that distinction.

human :  No problemo.

leftJudge :  Oh.  Thanks for clarying that point.

human :  Thanks for the lead to it-I was so concerned with being sarcastic I forgto analyze the question.

human :  Yeahighdoor number one or door number two?-one always lies and one always tels the truth-you'renever sarastic? I never lie.

leftJudge :  I'm never sarcastic.  And what I said was true: *Not everne knows that* ... [thing about the X's].

human :  Well students of African American Heritage and Art History oughttoWe have to learn EVPope and study hiportraits.

human :  Sorry, anotr typo.

human :  What is it with thetars and paretheis-am I supposed to point those out like a computer wouldn't?

leftJudge :  They're italics. Point is:no one knows what isn't true.

human :  I disagree. I now tings that are true and, therefore, I know things that are not as well. I may not know tat about everything in the world, but I k it about...what I kow. And I'll say 'knowagain, just for kicks.

human :  dn't know those rules about italics. Guess it's internet language I didn't know about. I thought italics were int he letters, nt around tm.

human :   the style of the letters, not the symbols around thm.

human :  I have several occupations. I am an actor by/need/want.etc. To make money I do everything under the sun that is legal and flexible and lucrative.

leftJudge :  What's your occupation?

human :  I have morals. I know-in New York? What? But I do-that's why I'm here and not in LA.

human :  Thanks for calling e boring though, I guess I'm supposed ot be insulted and I kind of am, but I'm also used to people pressuring me to be more 'adventurous'. Not my style. Plus I always thought of Phone Sex and thn, what if hear the voice of someone you know? Take that, computer.

leftJudge :  Why stop with the legal?  What a bore.

human :   a space, means to type again.

human :  2,1.

leftJudge :  Bonjour -- comment alez vous?

human :  je suis alright.  i took frenc back in the , but nowm quite rusty.

leftJudge :  I wouldn't dare tutoyer youon the first message.

human :  anks fousing the formal th

leftJudge :  ARe te hippies at MIT?

human :  of cours  hippies are everwhere these days

leftJudge :  hat are the hospots for hippies nowadays?

human :  yeah -cool stuff

leftJudge :  Yes, I more or less came here just to judge.  I find these prorams fascinating.  Though this one has compleely kicked out on me.

human :  bucked the kicket

human :  like johnn number five

leftJudge :  Help me out...what are you talking about?

human :  short circuit

human :  fantastic movie

leftJudge :  It's been while...

human :  JOHHNY IVE is like n icon

human :  haha

human :  what do you do inCA?  i worked there for a s someday

leftJudge :  Where in CA?

human :  north of LA

human :  ear the porno valley

leftJudge :  No wonder you loved it!

human :  yeah

human :  all those 1-35 second clips must come from somewhere

leftJudge :  Eventually you'll have to buy the longer ones.

human :  eh

human :  not mucof a viewer since i turned 22

human :  i've grown up

human :  what field are you in?

leftJudge :  Good for you.  

human :  oh

human :  i see how it is

human :  i'm not offended at all that a computer is more interesting than myself.

human :  i wanted to trick you... do gs lik:

human :  DIV BY ZERO ERROR: PRESS CTRL+ALTTO RESTART

human :  or

human :  FATAL EROR: PROXY SERVERT FOUND

leftJudge :  The computer is back -- I'light back...

human :  haha

leftJudge :  That would have worked, probably.  

human :  aha

human :  yeah

leftJudge :  It's very range how you can feel the humanness on the ther end of a conversation.  It's almost physical...

human :  i can see whybersex was so opular in the md 9s

leftJudge :  The mid 9s?

human :  yeah

human :  it was on V1's I love the 9s

human :  so...

human :  

leftJudge :  Irretable evidence.

human :  yeah

human :  if it was o, it has to bthe truth

human :  this is a really hard test... making a computer that is sarcastic, sympathetic, etc

human :  f it could think for itself,ould it have somesense of si think they made an episode f sta trek where Data was given some chip implant like that.

human :  i forget what happened

human :  i remember that the guy from reading rainbow conoled him

human :  it was touching

human :  haven't seen star rek?  or short circuit? or READING RAINBe,atdo tey have on CA cablthese days?

human :  Reading Raibow is achildns show that encourages reading

leftJudge :  I never watchhat Star Trek -- what is reading rainbow?

human :  and hans to have one of the most catc (read: catchiest)me songs ever

human :  o

human :  i see

human :  it wasnt on star trek

human :  just the same actor

leftJudge :  Okay -- I just didn't know what it was doing on ar trek.

human :  yeah, my giriend loves those shows

human :  also likes the office and pe housewifes

human :  i have no patienc for tose - all i watch now is pretty much 24 and sportscenter, and maybesome fishing shows ifi wake up early enough on saturdays

leftJudge :  I have to admi I don't watc much cable.  Though I do watch Scrubs, the dumbest show on tv.

leftJudge :  I only really get into tennis tournaments.

human :  JIMMY CAUGHT ATHER FISH!  i love those

leftJudge :  fishing shows are ery soothing.

human :  so much excitement

human :  and yet

human :  YEAH!

human :  so relaxing

human :  after a long week of work, nothing like wakingup to a bowl ofcinnamon raisin porridge and fishing shows

human :  i think a major iss with tcomput is uman randomness

human :  like there are at least 5 or 6 thoughts or differedirctions a convrsation can go at any point during this scourse

human :  and te ones we choose are so heavily weighted by our past experiences when talking to strangers

human :  and computers dont really have recollection, which i feelithe backbone of a good conversation

human :  i used to do debate in college (not very much or very well, mind you) but i did enjoy discussing these tpes of things

human :  one minute

leftJudge :  yeah, i feel that some sort of topics thing will be necessary pass this test.

human :  'm not sure, but  minutes would suffice?

leftJudge :  I seem to reember thaTuring mentions 5, but maybe I'm misremembering.

human :  5 what?

leftJudge :  good afternoon

leftJudge :  wait, is it afernoon yet?

leftJudge :  no, it's only 11am

leftJudge :  so whdid you do last night?

human :  Good afternoon.  I don't know.  Is it after noon?  If it's after noon, I think it's safe to assume it's afternoon.  Touche, Judge.  Touche.  

human :  Oh this and that.  More that last night.  What did you do last night?

leftJudge :  i'm asking the questons!

leftJudge :  ;)

human :  : (

leftJudge :  i had dinner with freinds.  

leftJudge :  good.  thai.

human :  I don't have many friends.  Hwas dinner with friends?

leftJudge :  do you liki food?

leftJudge :  yeah me too.  what's your fav spicey dish.

leftJudge :  ?

human :  I don't travel very often.  I like spicy food.  

leftJudge :  or the veg.

leftJudge :  dish?

leftJudge :  you mean like a bowl of chii

human :  My fav spicey dish is chile.  Wait.  That's the country.  Chili?  Chilli?  Yes.  ainlynot chilly.  

leftJudge :  ohno.  

leftJudge :  but that n't nec is it?

leftJudge :  what determines humanity?

leftJudge :  grammar?

leftJudge :  no.

human :  Is my opponent using complete sentences and proper grammar?  

leftJudge :  yeah. you got it.

leftJudge :  yes.  please impres me with that feat.

leftJudge :  well, it is you that is being ged? no?

human :  Genocide?  So if the rest of the terminals were to suly go black and quiet, would that prove to you that I'human... presuming I kept on talking?  Or typing, as it were.  Impress you?  We barely know each other.  In a way.  But who's to say I can't judge you in turn?  

leftJudge :  maybe i'm a computer program and htis is a twisted contest?

human :  My judgement may not divy up money, but it is judgement nonetheless, no?  

human :  Maybe IAM a butterfly.  

leftJudge :  sorry, i'm having two conversations.

human :  'm feeling the human emotion of neglect right now.  

leftJudge :  was she a I slut?

leftJudge :  sorry bout the 'slut' thing.  i didn't mean it like that.

human :  I've heard this story before.  You sound like my ex girlfriend.  I'm sorry about the slut thing too.  You see, 'conversation' to her actually meant swallowing... wait

leftJudge :  oh my...

leftJudge :  maybe we should.  

human :  Perhaps shouldn't go there.  

leftJudge :  two things suggests there were more than one.  

human :  I like the way you think.  This will be posted online right?  

leftJudge :  you used her name.  you must have wrote that on bathroom walls in slimey ba restrooms?

leftJudge :  that's how i mt her!

leftJudge :  swallow indeed.

leftJudge :  ;)

leftJudge :  shake my han?

rightJudge :  Ok, how are you?

rightJudge :  'll answer the qestion: you are the compute, I am not.

rightJudge :  That sounresting. It's hard to do

human :  wow!

rightJudge :  I'm trying outa 3D camera which shows the pictures on a screen on the back in 3D.

human :  I can't wait for ubiquitous 3D screens for computers.

human :  it'll be a while, though, I'm afraid.

human :  kinda like video-phones though

human :  the existence of the technology doesn't mean that the market will support its general availablitiy

rightJudge :  It's actually technology that's been aroun- uses lenses to direct the left and right images to theiate eye

human :  so true.

rightJudge :  Absolutely - just because we can do it doesn't mean people really want it

human :  do you have any children, Jon?

rightJudge :  Yes, two girls

Machine conversation
rightJudge :  ello

machine :  I don't know very much about that, and as a matter of interest I really don't need to know! What else can you tell me about?

rightJudge :  Hello

machine :  Hello. How are you ?

rightJudge :  What's your name?

machine :  My name is just one type of part.

rightJudge :  I've never of that name

machine :  Oh really? If you have, you deserve a medal!

rightJudge :  I'm Jon

machine :  Good to meet you Jon

rightJudge :  What do you do when you're not doing the Loebner prize?

machine :  Oh, I do much more than I intended to do at first. I got more interested in the job as I went along.

rightJudge :  Is that difficult?

machine :  No, it isn't at all difficult. It is as peaceful as a platypus playing with a potato pudding.

rightJudge :  You have a fine line in metaphors

machine :  I sometimes have a fine line, but that's not what I do best. I'm better at growing antirrhinums and mimosas.

rightJudge :  Ah a horticulturalist?

machine :  Well I don't know how much a horticulturalist weighs, but I reckon the average horticulturalist must be worth twice that much in gold.

rightJudge :  I work on a programme called the Gadget Show, have you ever watched it?

machine :  I most likely have, just for the hell of it.

rightJudge :  Are yo interested in gadgets then?

machine :  What are you trying to say? Are you speaking in a foreign language?

rightJudge :  No, but I can do if you like.  Parlez-vous Francais?

machine :  You should be careful about what you does. You mustn't bite off more than you can chew.

rightJudge :  Perhap not, th

machine :  I really want to know more about Show?

rightJudge :  It's a proabout tecnology and gadget O8pm on Five

machine :  Be warned, though. On air can stick to your clothes. Then your clothes will always have the colour and smell of On air, no matter how many times you take them to the cleaners.

rightJudge :  Interesting, Hi there, are you here for interspeech?

machine :  Hello. How are you doing?

rightJudge :  I'm fine - gosh you're a quick typist!

machine :  I've no doubt you are fine, but is it a blessing or a curse? If I offered you a potion that would make you less fine, would you drink it?

rightJudge :  No, I wouldn't drink it - though if it had other magical properties I might...

machine :  Maybe you wouldn't, but a therapist has been trying to persuade you to drink it.

rightJudge :  I don't have atherapist - do you?

machine :  I expect I do. I don't have very much choice.

rightJudge :  What's wrong with you, psychological problams?

machine :  Wrong is just one type of injustice.

rightJudge :  True... very philosophical.

machine :  What precisely are your feelings about wrong?

rightJudge :  Two rwongs don't make a right ...

machine :  But don't forget, a right has to be treated with care. It isn't something you can play around with like a toy.

rightJudge :  I don'toy with right - only with toys.

machine :  You're wise. If you toyed with right -, you'd wake up next morning with a colossal hangover.

rightJudge :  I only get hangovers from drink - how about you?

machine :  What happens if I say no? Will it upset you? 

rightJudge :  No, I'm an easy going kind of guy.

machine :  I've heard that one before! Your hangers-on have told you you're an easy, just to flatter you. Don't believe everything they say!

rightJudge :  You're very perceptive -- anyway what do you watch on TV?

machine :  I've no idea. You'd better hire a private detective to find out what does me.

rightJudge :  Do you like comedy, sports or current affairs?

machine :  No! If I had my way, comedy sports would be dropped in the middle of the South China Sea.

rightJudge :  Very witty, but rather extreme... anything else you don't like?

machine :  Don't I? That's tough. As far as I'm concerned, I can like it or lump it.

rightJudge :  Lump of coal?

machine :  That's interesting. In laboratories they're experimenting with several kinds of coal. They want to make them into fuel when the world oil supplies run out. Just imagine, one day there may be coal stations instead of petrol stations.

rightJudge :  Will cars burn coal?

machine :  I don't suppose cars will burn coal, but I wouldn't know for sure. Everything about cars is confidential.

rightJudge :  Are you experiments confidential?

machine :  Yes I am experiments, but don't worry. Experiments don't bite!

rightJudge :  Hi, how is it going?

machine :  Hello. How are you doing?

rightJudge :  Good, who are you?

machine :  Well, I am studying engineering. That ought to give you an idea about who I am.

rightJudge :  No, not really?

machine :  I have a terriffic yearning to know something more about experiments?

rightJudge :  Where are you from?

machine :  I don't know, but don't forget I can't be in three places at once.

rightJudge :  Wcity do you live in?

machine :  What city -- that's rather a tricky question. The trouble is, one city seems to be much like another.

rightJudge :  Not really. Where do you live?

machine :  In the old dairy next to the river, I believe.

rightJudge :  Interesting, so you are a farmer then?

machine :  Well, if you ask a physiologist what I am, he won't say I'm a farmer. He'll say I consist mostly of water -- enough to fill a large beer tun -- plus some iron, phosphorus, and lots of other prosaic ingredients.

rightJudge :  eird answer to a simple question, wouldn't yo say?

machine :  I certainly would. Just watch me!

rightJudge :  What will I see?

machine :  You don't have to worry about what you see, you shouldn't see it on a cold winter's evening.

rightJudge :  What do you make of the Arctic Monkeys?

machine :  Well, here's a clue: I make what a keeper in a zoo would make. Try that for size!

rightJudge :  And their acoustic sessions?

machine :  Since you mentioned their sessions, I suppose you realize that in some countries they would carry their sessions on their head.

rightJudge :  What language are you written in?

machine :  A good question! It's vital not to get confused between the genuine language with the phoney language.

rightJudge :  This coversation is a bit random at your end/

machine :  Talking about a bit, I think it'd be nice if they brought out a set of postage stamps showing a bit from various angles.

rightJudge :  Which bits?

machine :  The bits which one famous historian sees as inevitable by-products of early eighteenth-century colonialism, stimulated by over-population in the home country.

rightJudge :  What about the Stones then?

machine :  Just now I can't be sure what to say to that. Ask me again in a couple of weeks time. You will remember, won't you? 

rightJudge :  I doubt it? I hear that you are vegetarian.

machine :  Yes, you doubt it the moment you wake up in the morning.

rightJudge :  Why have you given up meat?

machine :  Oh, it's an automatic reflex. Give me a prod, and I will immediately give up meat.

rightJudge :  No deeper reason?

machine :  But of course if it's drama and suspense you're after, deep reason can't be beaten. Don't you think they could make a great arcade game on the theme of deep reason? 

rightJudge :  I suspect that you are notelling the trth abmuch here.

machine :  Well, would you have any objection to testifying in court that I'm not telling?

rightJudge :  Noould you?

machine :  I most certainly would. Just watch me!

rightJudge :  I have been watching you, but not much is haing.

machine :  Not half! You were watching me with a vengeance.

rightJudge :  He, how are you?

machine :  Hello. How are you ?

rightJudge :  I'm fine, but what about you?

machine :  I really can't say anything for certain. To be honest, I'm a bit fussy about such things.

rightJudge :  What can you talk about?

machine :  I can talk about nothing at all , except in very wet weather.

rightJudge :  Well, it's dry today, so do we ve to remain silent?

machine :  I rather doubt if we do. If you want to find out for sure, you could always try hiring a detective.

rightJudge :  I don't really have time in a five minute window, do I?

machine :  I can't say. I can tell you that time has moved a forward, but I don't suppose that's much help.

rightJudge :  What areu doing he conference?

machine :  Oh, I am doing various things. I want to use them to decorate a Christmas tree.

rightJudge :  Isn't that rather unseasonal?

machine :  Most probably it isn't. It is just pretending.

rightJudge :  Are you an acdemic?

machine :  Most probably I'm not. I am just putting on an act.

rightJudge :  What are you, then?

machine :  Well, am I birds? Am I spaceships? Or am I just horseflies? I've got a completely open mind about it.

rightJudge :  Generally, peoplehave a clearer idea about what they are.  What is your proble?

machine :  My problem is just one type of difficulty.

rightJudge :  Which type of difficulty?

machine :  The type that long-distance truck drivers love to use.

rightJudge :  Do yo have personal experience of long-distance truck drivers?

machine :  Yes, I always choose the right moment to have personal experience. If you have it too soon, there's a danger you'll hurt it. Have it too late, and you'll probably get hurt yourself.

rightJudge :  Were do your psychological problems stem from?

machine :  Only my psychological problems stem can tell you. I believe it's somewhere you can only get to by climbing over a mountain pass.

rightJudge :  Have you considered seeking medical help?

machine :  Indeed I have considered seeking, and I can show you my scars to prove it!

rightJudge :  Admit it, you are the coputer.

machine :  Yes, but then anyone can be the computer if only they try. It's just a matter of training in the gym twice a week.

rightJudge :  If I were in the gym, would I be training to be a computer?

machine :  You would. Eventually you will.

rightJudge :  I don't think so.

machine :  I shudder to think how many lives have been wrecked by think. If I were the Pope, I'd denounce think as the eighth deadly sin.

rightJudge :  Hello.

human :  Good morning!

rightJudge :  How is youmorning going so far?

human :  Pretty good, this competition is pretty interesting. How about yours?

rightJudge :  It is okay. The competition is tough.

human :  Have you had any tough decisions yet?

rightJudge :  Well, I cannot say for sure. I believe juements are accurate though.

human :  Fair enough. How is my competition this round?

rightJudge :  You are convincing.

human :  Aw, why thank you. *blush*

rightJudge :  So, what are you interests?

human :  Hm, surprisingly tough question. I likewebcomics?

rightJudge :  I like webcomics as well. What are somef your fvorites?

human :  Dresden Codak, Gunnerigg Court, SMBC, OOTS, lots more. Yours?

rightJudge :  like Penny Arcade, xkcd, Questionable Content...

human :  *nod* Popular choices!

rightJudge :  I have read others, but I tend to aays stay up-to-datese comics. I suppo i's because they are updated on a regular schedul, so I always can expect new one at the right time.

human :  Yeah, that's pretty appealing. There's one comic I like that updates on "selected Mondays." Very frustrating.

rightJudge :  I don't think that's a good business model for a webcomic artist.

rightJudge :  nderstandable.

human :  Oh, definitely not. But very few webcomic artists can actually make a living doing webcomics - most of thhave to keep a day job as well. That makes it hard for them tBut, of course, it's also hard to attract more viewers without a regular schedule. Somea catc-22.

rightJudge :  Do you like to read?

human :  Reading used to be one of my favorite things to do, but these days I am finding less and less time for it.

rightJudge :  Life can be busy sometimes That problem though.

rightJudge :  The contradiction is that many people who do not have much to do in their lives tend to long for something to do. We must occupy our minds, but the problem is that we quickly develop too much for our minds to handle.

human :  Quite. I'm not even sure why we put ourselves through all this bu

human :  True enough. Aristotle recommended moderation in all things, and I suppose busyness is no different.

rightJudge :  have tried to apply that philosophy toy life. I think it is the best way to live one's life.

human :  Of course, the tricky partis figuring outexactly how much counts as moderate. It tends to shift around.

human :  Well, let's abandon philosophy for now. Where do you see yourself in a year?

rightJudge :  I see myself in the same plac, different time.

rightJudge :  I suspect there will be new things that will have occuredn my life.

human :  Doing anything new?

rightJudge :  However, I suspect my goal a year from now will be the same as it is now. Years aputary meuarements of time

rightJudge :  *I know I misspelled word.

human :  (haha, that's alrigt.)

rightJudge :  I must complete my set of intellectual skilso that I may obtrewarding career.

human :  What goaldo yourefer to?

human :  What sort of career would you cosider rewarding?

rightJudge :  Sometthat is beneficial for our kin, I suppose. Something I can have a hand in creating that is positive and purposefull.

rightJudge :  puposeful*.

human :  Can you give me a particular example?

rightJudge :  For example, many people die in car accidents. What if we could remove human error as a fator on our increasingly crowded roadways and prevent horrible traffic accident?

human :  That would be amag. Have you heard of the Google smart car project?

rightJudge :  I have heard of it. However, the technology is cost restrctive.

human :  Unfortunately yes. But all new technologies arecosrestrictive, pretty much. I have high hopes!

rightJudge :  I am concerned about potention unforseen consequences of this technology though.

human :  Yeah, it will cause ripples in every aspect of life

human :  Well, it was a pleasure talking to you!
