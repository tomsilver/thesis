leftJudge :  but can't a machine think?

machine :  It may be possible.

leftJudge :  and conscious?

machine :  Not after i'm done with you.

leftJudge :  what are you going to do to me?

machine :  Nothing. I just wanted to talk.

leftJudge :  what about?

leftJudge :  es - I got back last week from sailing in teh Aeolian Islands, which was fatastic.

machine :  Oh, yes first I ddnt realize - did you get seasick or you are already used to it?

leftJudge :  I did actually.  I was very ill for 2 days, but ot my sa legs and was fine.  I get sesick evey time I go sailing.

machine :  Do you have a licence to sail?

leftJudge :  You dneed one - rather alarmingly, anyone can sail a boat.  Although, if you want to charter one a company, thewill require some proof that you know what you are doing!

machine :  Aha ... anyway does swimming help in such a ituation? Or it doesn/t matter

leftJudge :  I don't know - I certafeltlike jumping overboard, but I idn't try it!  I just wait for it to go away, because I know it will eventuall.

machine :  Sorry just back to youression, before I forget - what s your main profile or how to ask

leftJudge :  I'm a barrister.

leftJudge :  THank you!

leftJudge :  I do, but I also love my work, so I don'nd working long hours if I have to.

machine :  ust because as a woman I thought

machine :  And which territory do you work or it is secret? 

machine :  (Sorry not territofield)

leftJudge :  Is notsecret 'm hong eventually to work in public law.  It's not aelyfema-friendly work environment, but it's so much beer than it used to be.  There aer lots of womeristers now.

machine :  Pion.. though I am not sure I know what is public law but I will find it out. 

leftJudge :  It's basically anything where the government or a publicbody is one of the parties.  It covers all human rights law,udicial review of administrative bodies and's really interesting - immigration, prisons, and all sorts.

leftJudge :  Me too!

machine :  Oh... hope I wont have any issuor where public law is cerned

machine :  What is your hobby?

leftJudge :  Well, I like reading, playing bridge, andcooking (especially cake).  How about you?

machine :  reading!!! tennis, freinds, talking to everyone (rather humans than mashines), making jokes, traveling..bridge .. would like to learn as well. supposed to help me staying freshminded

leftJudge :  You shoul it's a great game.  

leftJudge :  Dinitely - it's great for memory and concentration.  And chatting ihe gaps.

machine :  Do you partcipate intour or match I dont know how to call it

leftJudge :  No - just play with friends.

machine :  Are you from London?

leftJudge :  iginally I'm from w Zealand, but I've lived in London fornd and for 2.

machine :  Settled here? I guess. Sop dyou study here already?

leftJudge :  Yes, I've been here since I years old. Soeally very English now!

machine :  Congratulations again!!! My father keeps saying all the time that he is already ired of all the people somplaining so he wants to go to NZ and have some sheeps and peace!!!

leftJudge :  It's certainly the no.1 destination if you want sheep and peace!  

machine :  In this order

leftJudge :  :)

machine :  I give yome time to talk to the machine as well.. you really type very fast!

leftJudge :  It's om taling to you both simultanely.  I do type fast - it's the only way tosurvive work!

machine :  Do you have a secretary or somebody typist?

leftJudge :  No - I do it all myself!  Barristers are self-employed so they do all their own work, unless they are so ressful that they can employ a personal assistat!

machine :  You also dont have ind of office with other abrristers together?

leftJudge :  It's a weird set-up - Lots ofristers get together and share premises and administrative staff, but they are alself-emplo, so it's not a firm or a partnership or a company. t's veryusual/

machine :  Aha ...I understand. (I hope) Do you haalways like a mase or several at the same time

leftJudge :  I have several at a time - I do some cases which just involve written work, anhers which involve going to court.

machine :  Is it in Fleet Stret as well this Royalourt

leftJudge :  I wish!  The Royal Courts of Justice on Fleet Street are where I'd like toappear in the future, when I'm a bit moenior!

machine :  see,  already have foreseen it

leftJudge :  :)

machine :  Why do you participate in this Loebner Prize 

leftJudge :  I rsomeone else who couldn't make it.  I did a ilosophy degree so I knew about the Turing Test and this competition and really wand to come.  Mhusband is a sotware engineer, so he's pretty envious!

leftJudge :  How about yout?

machine :  Oh.. 

machine :  I got  aphone call and was also interested, though I didnt know anything about Turing test. But since I am not so long here yet I wouldlike to useevery chance to see new things, try, meet etc.

leftJudge :  Sounds very sensible.  

machine :  I dont know just ...wuite en minded maybe. In this period of my luife

leftJudge :  Have you enjoyed it so far?

leftJudge :  ell, that's nice to hear!  It was good to talk to you too.

leftJudge :  Bye!

machine :  To be honest this conversation was the most inetersting... But othese I prefer to see my cobnversation partnersHello, my name is Joan and I am a human.

leftJudge :  Ah, a woman! All my other conversants this mroning have been men.

machine :  So we can restore the balance a bit, that's good.  Have you had an inteing time, I hope so.

leftJudge :  O yes, pretty interesting. Actually one of the others wa scalled JOhn but said she was a woman!

machine :  Do you thik that could be part of an unusual name or was it to catch you out?

leftJudge :  I think perhaps he/she misunderstood an instryction. Wasn't  anative E. speaker.

machine :  We all make mistakes - you just have, nevermind.  What is on your mind, right now?

leftJudge :  I'm still remembering a play I saw yesterday.

machine :  At a theatre or was it a recording?

machine :  Are you o ovether.

leftJudge :  Yes ok, but was distracted by the otehr person! It was in a theatre.

machine :  Which one?

leftJudge :  The Venue, in Lesiceter Place. Know it?

machine :  I don't know that one - old or more new?

leftJudge :  Perhaps old, but done up i mostudio style -- lots of Auusies there by the way

machine :  Does it have new play) o - was the one you saw new?

leftJudge :  yes, pretty new -- young Auusie playwright, modern play, v. funny, lots of crude Auuise humour!!

machine :  What was it about?

leftJudge :  Aussies livign in London and their resultant ings of dplacemane and alienation

leftJudge :  dplacemane = displacement

machine :  I was just guessing that, kind of you to confirm, did you hear mewondering, or was it the Universal Subconscious?!

leftJudge :  theer was a delay in rplaying and as you;'d been quick before I geussed yoere scratching your head!

machine :  Anyway, about the plahat were the tes, or the plot?

leftJudge :  troubles with lovelife, feeling lonely because far from home, feeling that Brits are too cold, even though enjoying teh high life in London -- not any huge overarching plot line

leftJudge :  Ishat a situation youyourself are familiar with?

machine :  Still an adventure then?  Unfortunatel, a lot of people travel longdistances to live elsewhere for y and they are not prepared.  

machine :  Yes, but not as much from my own life s with people I know and have knon.  Interestingly,I've heard Antipodeans complain, and be surised, that now they have followedBritish colleagues over here, those colleagueshave less of a social life as they are at home again, but then they were in Australia/NZ the Britsnt out a lot with them.

leftJudge :  That's most interesting. Funnily enough I find I can feel at home wherever I'm living, even if I don;t like the environment much. But I'm a bot of a hermit.

machine :  Are there not people whoan feel at home almost anywhere, provided they have som familiar things in their accomodation, and are cfortable with themseves, and have their immediate needs met?

leftJudge :  Yes, and I suppose that that was my situation. Wife, work, etc all in place. Going alone and with uncertai propsects must feanyone with uncertain feeling

machine :  Must do, but when you go as a couple there is the otre difficul, experiences to cope wnon-ditly too.  Sometimes one is alone all day, or things don't work at with studying or work etc for them, even if they do for the other partner.  Tt's tough.

leftJudge :  That's a good point and indeed later on in my time in teh USAy wofe had disappointing work ppects and that had a bad effect on us all over

machine :  I'm sorry for both of you, feeling under-used and under-valued has kck-on effects, but the person d their abilities are the same.  Did it get better for her?

leftJudge :  Well, she came back to the UK a few years before I did so we had some transatlantuc commuting!

machine :  Brave - absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder, and it is worth trying.  Tiring, though, extra travel, I mean.

leftJudge :  There's truth in taht saying, and the travel wasn't  abig problem. You certaionly mlearn how to make best use of time together, a skill many people lack!

machine :  Well done, tru abtime management being a skill.  Sometimes it comes down to doing what s most important, doesn't it.ke having fun at the theatre - you made a goohoice n going to see something which s in your thoughts the next day.  We have to be selective as we can't do or see it all.

leftJudge :  Very true. What most enriches your own life outsiode of work?

machine :  wow, good question.  Learning new things, notkills necessarily but life lessons, sorry f itsounds a cliche.  I mean the things that help usbe ok with ourselves, let go of bad situations and things.

human :  Does God need reinventing?

rightJudge :  I'd say so yes.

rightJudge :  He left a lot unanswered (he/she)

rightJudge :  And a lot of sloppy work in my opinion

rightJudge :  But that's nto the point

rightJudge :  It seems to be a nof intelligent behaviour to invent god

human :  Ok. Well I can't really answer your questions. 

rightJudge :  Why not?

human :  Because I don't know how one goes about "reiventing God"

rightJudge :  t have toow how to do it in order to have aopinino about it

human :  and why would machines want to do that anyway?

rightJudge :  why ld le want to do that?

human :  do they?

rightJudge :  Well we  have many times over

human :  I'm not a religious person myself, so I tend to not think about these things. It doesn't really interest me.

rightJudge :  ?

rightJudge :  Right.  That's a challenge.  Shall we start with your hobbies?

human :  Sounds fine to me.

rightJudge :  What do you like doing in your spare time?  Reading?  Films?  Sport?

human :  I have very little spare time, and you?

rightJudge :  Well, I have enough I think.  That's a she for you.  Perhaps you should do less work.

human :  You're a machine.

rightJudge :  I'm not a machine -m a human!

human :  Well, if you bring your husband, andI bring my husband, it might work.

human :  I have no idea why you keep on insisting that you are human. The evidence s all there.

human :  Don't confuse me.

rightJudge :  you like fils?

human :  What do you think oour current governor?

human :  Certain types have appeal.

rightJudge :  I don't have a governor myself.  Do you?

human :  I don't know. There are so many. Who's your favouite author?

rightJudge :  Well,. I don't mind how muhair you have.  

human :  I would hope that we don't share the same memory.

human :  Why did you think I was Joan?

rightJudge :  I think you told me you were called Joan.  Were you fibbing?

human :  U2 is a very old, cruddy rock band that deserves to be wiped off the face of the earth.

rightJudge :  I don't like their music, but I think wiping them off the rth might be little drastic.  You could just not buy their records.

human :  Whatever, change the topic.

rightJudge :  Ok.  What do you think about ther leadership dispute?

human :  Current affairs is a broad subject. Which particular thing would you like to discuss?

rightJudge :  Do you think Tony Blair is awful?

human :  There aremany names on the world.

rightJudge :  That is true.  Shall we talk about something els?

rightJudge :  17?

human :  Don't see how it would turn out much better, but go ahead.

human :  You changed the subject again.

rightJudge :  Sorry.

rightJudge :  Are you in the field of ompuetr Sci?

human :  Difficult question. Surely not in a digal matrix.

human :  Yes.

rightJudge :  Dance? Sure, that would be fun, tho it has been a long time. You a good dancer?

rightJudge :  That sort of dance! Wht feelings coursew thriough you as you dance or inhale tocins?

human :  Yes, and then we could have a fight (you would win) and then later on we could intoxicate each other with mouldy fruit juice.

human :  OkayI have to go. Eat something ut I will return withing 3 minutes.

rightJudge :  But then you'll miss the rest of our talks, and I want to ask you ab the rhumba!

human :  I don't want to become a doctor; I want to be a writer.

rightJudge :  Good, what sort of literature?

human :  I'd like to have an acre full of growing strawberries all year long.

rightJudge :  So you coudl m,ake your moulfy fruitjuice??

rightJudge :  I don;t knoWhat do you think?

rightJudge :  Are you referring to someone called "Dead"? Otherwise I didn;t undertanmd your answer.

rightJudge :  I thought you said you were human! I#m all covered in confusion!

human :  I am a human bot.
